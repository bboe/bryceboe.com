My undergraduate education at UCSB can simply be described as AMAZING.
Achieving my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science over the past four
years was the best time of my life. My memories of the time will last on
forever and with social networking sites it will hopefully be much
easier to remain in contact with all the wonderful friends I made over
the years.
