I knew I forgot something else that I wanted to put in my previous post. Sunday
December 3rd our Gaucho Soccer team defeated UCLA in 27 degree weather for the
NCAA Championship. Scott Adam and I contemplated driving all night to St. Louis
when we learned of our shoot out victory over Wake Forest Saturday. However
since we would have had to beat the google maps estimated time we decided
against it; though I thought we could make it.

We settled for watching the game on TV, and it was the most glorious soccer
game we've seen. In the first five minutes we scored and over the period of the
game we had many more attempts than UCLA. It was nerve racking once UCLA scored
however, we were still up one, and as the minutes ticked down we found
ourselves victorious.

Our school stopped UCLA from attaining their 100th NCAA Championship as we
doubled our number of championships to 2. It was an exciting week as we got
free ice cream and free t-shirts. I joked with Adam and Scott about how we
first be UCLA in the programming competition and then beat them on the Soccer
Field.

And now a [video of the celebration after the game][]. We finally marched the
goal post through Isla Vista and threw it off the bluffs to the ocean.

Congrats UCSB Soccer! I can't wait for next season.
