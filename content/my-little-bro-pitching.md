This past weekend my littlest brother pitched for the first time. Word has it
that he pitched 3 consecutive strikeouts! Go Connor. However, this word needs
to be taken with a grain of salt as it comes from our mom, who as most moms do,
occasionally neglect unfavorable details.

My past weekend involved getting scuba certified with Adam, Daria, and Margaux
as we did our four beach dives. We now can rent scuba tanks and are \_allowed\_
to dive down to 60 feet. I must say that scuba is awesome, though I'd much
prefer having gills to wearing ~75 pounds worth of gear. [Gillyweed][] would be
sweet too. Unfortunately it doesn't exist... yet.
