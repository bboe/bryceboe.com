I took a drive down to Ventura with my girlfriend this weekend and I must say
that some people need to learn some common courtesy driving rules. Mainly
moving to a right lane if someone is approaching from the rear so as to avoid
the dangerous [passing on the right][] move. This driver that I initially
zipped up behind refused to pull over for the duration of the drive. Upon
realizing that passing this driver on the left would be difficult I performed a
few actions in hopes of persuading the driver to move over. The actions include
tailgating and the back up, close in method of which neither proved
successful. I'm not sure if this driver was oblivious to my attempts or was
single-handedly trying to stop me from passing, but not only did he refuse to
move over to the right, he also moved into a newly opened left lane rather than
allowing me use of this lane to pass.

To greater explain the situation there was a good quarter of a mile in front of
his car, and there was plenty of room for him to move to the right. Of course
the means that I could have easily passed on the right, but despite [Section
21754][] stating that it is legal, the move is dangerous and makes it more
difficult for these drivers to move over due to passing cars on the
right. Further more this perpetuates the problem as in time these drivers will
assume that others will pass on the right; I call this suffering from passing
on the right syndrome.

I'm not suggesting it should be illegal to drive in the fast lane but rather
suggesting be courteous (and safe) by moving over when approached by a faster
moving vehicle so that the faster driver may pass safely. If you feel the need
to get back in the fast lane after allowing the driver to pass on the left then
by all means treat yourself.

I've recently read the Code of Hammurabi and I think a good punishment for
failure to yield to faster drivers would be for every car that passes you on
the right your auto insurance increases one percent. Seems pretty fair, and
much better than impalement, although I wouldn't mind that either.
