Title: Strict Vista License

For those that [don't already know][] Microsoft's Windows Vista license looks
to be quite unfriendly to a few groups of people. Mainly those who upgrade
their computers on a regular basis as well as those who wish to run windows on
a virtual machine. In their license it specifies that the license can only be
transferred once which essentially means an owner of the software may only
upgrade their machine once.

Further more for the cheap versions (not cheap at all) windows cannot be run
virtual at all, and only the Ultimate Edition can be used virtually. This means
everyone currently using [Paralles][] with their Mac to run Windows software is
out of luck unless they want to shell out [$399 for Vista Ultimate][].

I imagine they'll take steps to prevent this type of use however should they
decide to do, then I expect many virtualized Windows users to not bother with
it. I kind of hope this is the case as well because it should help push the
open source community.

My recommendation is obvious, learn to use something other than windows; it's
free. And if you happen to see me at a Microsoft meeting, I'm only there for
the free stuff.
