This is my first pelican post using markdown. I have yet to import all my old
blog entries as I first need to make sure I can make it work from scratch.

Below is the skeleton python program that I always start out with:

    :::python
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import os
    import sys

    def main():
        return 0

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        sys.exit(main())

Let's see how it looks!
