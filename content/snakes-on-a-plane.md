With that out of the way I'm going to go see this mother f\*\*\*ing movie about
mother f\*\*\*ing snakes on a mother f\*\*\*ing plane **TONIGHT**! If you're
wondering why I keep using the phrase "mother f\*\*\*ing" see [this clip from
the Daily Show][].

I am about as excited as [Samuel L. Jackson][] in that clip for this movie. My
housemates and I text message each other "Snakes on a plane" about five times a
day and we all agree that tonight is going to be *crazy*. There's going to be
partying followed by waiting in line for good seats. Once in the theater there
is a guaranteed roar of the audience when the title "Snakes On A Plane Appears"
and every time Samuel L. Jackson says "mother f\*\*\*in'" produced by us Isla
Vistians who are also known as Santa Barbarians. Normally the majority of Isla
Vistians are apathetic thus being hard to gather anywhere besides around a
[Beirut][] table. However we always manage to unite whenever the cause is
right, and tonight that's Samuel L. Jackson and mother f\*\*\*in' Snakes On A
Plane!
