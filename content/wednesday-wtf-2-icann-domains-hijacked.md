On June 27 [New York Times reported][] that Turkish Hackers 'hijacked' a
few of the [ICANN][] (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers) domain names. Last Thursday (July 3) ICANN [confirmed][] these
attacks mentioning that social hacking was partially involved. It should
not be possible that the company in charge of assigning IP address and
domain names loses, even temporarily, control of their domain names? Of
course they are probably constantly under attack, nonetheless wtf?
