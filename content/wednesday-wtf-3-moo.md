This one isn't really a surprise to me, but I couldn't really find anything
better. Someone posted [this][] nearly two year old unresolved [Ubuntu][] bug
to [digg][].

The bug filer complains that the current cow displayed when someone types
apt-get moo does not look like an actual cow. The following is output from my
terminal:

    :::text
    bboe@sybok:~$ apt-get moo
             (__)
             (oo)
       /------\/
      / |    ||
     *  /\---/  
       ~~   ~~
    ...."Have you mooed today?"...

The following is what the cow would look like if today's patch is accepted:

    :::text
             (__)
     _______~(..)~
       ,----\(oo)
      /|____|,'
     * /"\ /  

    ...."Have you mooed today?"...

Oh and the new version is a super cow, as can be seen with the cape it is
wearing. Haha, wtf? I just love the way open source software works.
