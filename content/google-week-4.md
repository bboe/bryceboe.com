[A Loss -- RIP Jaymie Darrow][]

Lately I have been writing my Google updates on Sunday, unfortunately after
hearing of Jaymie's death, I didn't feel like writing about my week, and it
still feels inappropriate to do so, but life must go on.  The following is very
ranty, I apologize.

Last week I finally started making progress on my project. The group I'm
working for wishes to have a set of tests to run when kernels are updated to
see how the performance of various kernel aspects have changed
overtime. Fortunately there is this testing environment called [autotest][]
which is open source, and from what I can tell started as a Google
project. Anyway, last week I familiarized myself with the parts of autotest
necessary to complete my project. I even somewhat inherited a side project
which is assisting with some beta testing of autotest from our local branch.

I used the Google showers for the first time after some pre-lunch volleyball. I
attended a talk on why women should not donate their eggs for money. Basically
the lady was saying all the risks are currently unknown and some women develop
[Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome][].  Though she had no numbers to support
her claim, she connected many women with cancer following egg donation, some
resulting in death.  Additionally she mentioned the website [Hands Off Our
Ovaries][] a few times.

Wednesday morning I coined a new term, albeit a fairly dumb term.  Nonetheless
the term is qiki, pronounced quickie. As all words in the English language
containing a 'q' have a 'u' immediately after, I decided that the 'u' is simply
implied. Anyways qiki means to quickly wiki something, and should be used in
the cases where someone quickly wikis something so that they seem as if it were
already something they knew. This came about when I was chatting with a friend
and she mistakenly wrote "did you just qiki that" rather than "did you just
wiki that."  Anyway feel free to now uses phrases such as:

> "Did you qiki that?"  
>  "No, however I just qikied your mom."  
>  "Qiki this!"  
>  "I accuse you of qikiing, you qikier."

Tuesday evening I made my [second wikipedia edit][] after watching some Star
Trek in which they the Next Generation crew visited DS9. Along those lines I am
now on the final season of The Next Generation.  Wednesday evening I went out
with Victor and Art in Palo Alto, and Thursday evening I went to Los Gatos to
celebrate Alaina's birthday.  Both nights were fun, and I'm glad I was able to
spend Alaina's birthday with her. Saturday I joined Eric and Art in San
Francisco for a night in the City. I enjoyed my first San Francisco bus
ride. We got pretty toasty, spent upwards of $60 each and crashed at another
friend's house who had just returned from a flight; she's a flight attendant.

Saturday I came to the realization that I hadn't backed up my computer in
nearly a year so started doing that. Not wanting to burn my backups to DVDs, I
signed up for [Amazon's S3 storage service][] and am working on a few scripts
to move my files to the remote backup. The one thing I didn't like about their
storage service is there is not an out of the box way to upload files to the
service. One either needs a third party's software or be a developer
themselves. Fortunately the latter applies to me. I quickly found an existing
python library called [awspylib][] and while testing I found a minor bug and
contacted the source owner. He made me an owner of the project and I then
submitted [my changes][] to the svn repository. Additionally after a few emails
he offered me the possibility of a summer internship for next year at the
company he works for, [Isilon Systems][]. It seems that it would actually be
relevant to my research, so I'll have to keep that in mind nine months from
now.

Well, again I apologize to anyone that read though this poorly written post. I
of course want people to read what I write, but on the other side much of this
content is for my own archiving purposes, and for my future children to
read. This actually reminds me of two things. I need to backup my site, and
that I have wanted to write a blog entry to my future children describing my
current thoughts on parenthood. That one will be interesting, especially when I
read it twenty or so years from now.
