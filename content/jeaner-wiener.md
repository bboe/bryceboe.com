Upon celebrating Adam's 20th birthday last night the question regarding
the proper name of a protrusion caused by the zipper of pants came up.
Growing up in the Rancho Bernardo area of San Diego I was familiar with
the term 'jeaner wiener' and hence forth would not accept anything less
fitting to describe this very common occurrence.

Anyways while outside I brought up the term jeaner wiener to which many
were stunned as they were not familiar with it. I briefly explained
jeaner wiener and a majority of those present accepted it as the
appropriate term, however Scotty was not one of them. Scotty insisted
that this occurrence is known as moose knuckle and I immediately refuted
his argument as it made no sense. After a few minutes of argument we
discovered we were not on the same page. After all was said an done this
is what we established:

[Camel toe][] -- despite what others may think, camel toe is reserved
for women only.

Moose knuckle -- same form as camel toe, however used when describing
the occurrence for men.

Jeaner wiener -- a single protrusion caused by a folded zipper which can
apply to both men and women, and usually only occurs when sitting down.
