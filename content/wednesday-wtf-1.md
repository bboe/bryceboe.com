I came across this today and am very curious as to why this is:  
<http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=107666>

> If you used Open Firmware Password utility to create a password that contains
> the capital letter "U", your password will not be recognized during the
> startup process (when you try to access Startup Manager, for example).

After reading this I decided I must post this immediately and since it's
Wednesday I'm starting a hopefully new recurring section of my blog called
"Wednesday WTF". So please comment as to why you think this might be. One other
thing is the page which describes settings up the Open Firmware protection does
not anywhere mention to avoid using an uppercase 'U' -- WTF?
