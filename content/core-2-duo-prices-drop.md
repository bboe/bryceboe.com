While updating [priceTrackr][] tonight I noticed that newegg has dropped their
prices for the Intel Core 2 Duo series processors. I think I'll still wait
awhile before I make my next upgrade.

The changes are as follows:

-   [X6800][] dropped $105.01 - now $1149.99
-   [E6700][] dropped $99.01 - now $599.99
-   [E6600][] dropped $89.01 - now $369.99
-   [E6400][] dropped $39.01 - now $259.99
-   [E6300][] dropped $10.01 - now $218.99

My [priceTrackr][1] service is expected to launch on Monday once I complete the
FAQ, About, and contact pages. It's looking quite good though I must say and
hopefully doesn't have IE problems like this page. If you would like to beta
test please contact me.
