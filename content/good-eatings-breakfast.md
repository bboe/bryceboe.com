I've been meaning to do this at least once all summer.

I arrived at Cafe Moma for breakfast at approximately 9:15 and I filled
my plate with the following:

-   2 Pancakes which I put a very light amount of raspberry syrup on
-   A piece of Sourdough French Toast, with a little maple syrup
-   A scoop of Roasted Chicken and Avocado Scrambled eggs
-   A scoop of Moma's Home Fries, which I add a little Moma salsa to
-   A slice of cantaloupe
-   A small glass of water

Everything but the french toast and avocado scramble are part of my
standard breakfast. French toast seems to appear every few weeks, and
the scrambles vary from day to day. Once I got back to my office I
grabbed the "Green Machine" variety of Naked juice which I'm still
sipping on. I'm full but I can't help but wonder what I'll be having for
lunch...
