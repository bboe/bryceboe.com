Okay, so I will probably never hear that line in a serious situation.
Nonetheless I'm excited because this morning I received a letter which starts:

> Dear Mr. Boe,
>
> We are pleased to inform you that you have been admitted to the Ph.D. program
> in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) --
> with five years of full financial support. We reserve this prestigious offer
> for our top candidates only. We are very impressed with your qualifications
> and are confident that you will do very well in our program. Furthermore, we
> believe that our faculty's research interests are a perfect match with your
> own. We hope that you will find our program exciting and your study at UCSB
> intellectually rewarding. Congratulations on this accomplishment; consider it

Oh, I'm glad I love Santa Barbara because I'm going to be here five more years.
