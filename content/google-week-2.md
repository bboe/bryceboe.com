On Monday, I discovered pancake breakfast is pretty standard at the Moma
Cafe and oh so delicious. Tuesday I had an awesome time playing
volleyball. Lots happened Wednesday. I had my first experience with a
modern bidet and I believe it went something like the following.

I went into the bathroom to deuce it up, and upon opening the stall I
uttered, "what the fuckâ€? which fortunately no one was there to hear.
I was baffled because the back of the toilet seat had some sort of
contraption, and there was a control box affixed to the side of the
stall. Proceeding with caution I put the seat down, put a piece of the
butt paper down and I sat upon the toilet. At this moment I let out a
faint pleasurable "ooohâ€? due to warm comforting feel of the seat
upon my butt. Yes it was heated.

While I was doing my business I was checking out the controls to the
side. I was quite intrigued by the button that read "rear cleaningâ€?
so after dropping the kids off at the pool I pressed the button. Next
came the noise of the servo followed by a warm stream of water. I then
proceeded to try the drier button but decided against the last button as
I didn't think a front cleaning would do me much good. Bidets are
awesome.

Wednesday continued when three of my college friends, A, E, and M came
to visit me for lunch. They were quite impressed by Google and seemingly
determined that they picked the wrong choice of college major. I
reminded them that Google hires non-computer science students as well,
but they were skeptical.

Finally Wednesday at work ended amazingly as I had my free massage. Let
me just say it was incredible and much needed after the soreness from
Tuesday's volleyball. Following the massage I met up with A, E and M
that visited for lunch for dinner at a Chicago style pizza place called
Patxi's which was quite delicious. Damn, Wednesday was awesome.

Not too much exciting happened on Tuesday, I was just finishing up stuff
for the long weekend, which the weekend was pretty awesome. Along with
the A, E, and M I went into the city for the 4th. Because it was a
pretty nice afternoon, and for other possibly dumb reasons, we decided
to walk from basically the Bay Bridge to the Golden Gate Bridge. It was
a long, but enjoyable 6 mile walk. After reaching our destination I
played a little flip cup and then the four of us headed toward Berkeley
for fireworks and pizza. Saturday I worked on priceTrackr, and today I
did a hike/walk of the Stanford Dish area with E.

Finally this evening I went to dinner in Newark with part of my second
family. We had some delicious sushi of which I am still full, then went
back and celebrated an early birthday followed by some wii Guitar Hero.
Finally it's bed time. Night.
