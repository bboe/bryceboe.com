This is a ridiculously silly post however I predict it will work out in
my favor and if not at least it only required a minuscule amount of my
time. Besides I needed something to post on my blog anyway.

I was just texting with a friend who happens to be learning C++ in which
I wanted to text her, "the STL is your friend when you figure it out",
however at that point in the message I was over the dreaded 160
character limit thus I shortened that to "the STL is your friend WYFIO".
I immediately sent a second message defining WYFIO and laying claim to
defining the acronym. You'll note I'm not laying claim to the first use
of the acronym; that'd just be ridiculous. ;)

My next thought process was that someone else had to have already
defined this particular acronym. However a [Google][], [bing][], and
[YAHOO!][] search turned up no results save for [this one][] (post \#2)
which uses the acronym in the same way I am, but fails to define it.

Let it be known that here on this 9th day of February, 2010 I, Bryce
Boe, first defined the acronym WYFIO as being short for "when you figure
it out".

I even previously [tweeted][] this announcement just to lay my claim a
tad quicker.
