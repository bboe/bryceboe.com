Paper writing is a time of absolute procrastination and major
productivity with everything but the paper it self. The following is the
list of things I've accomplished since setting out to write my paper.

1.  Put together my new computer (I've restrained from installing
    everything as I don't have my hard drive yet)
2.  Drink
3.  Go to a few parties
4.  Sleep
5.  Watch tv
6.  Drink
7.  Come up with an idea for a new service
8.  Register [thepricetracker.com][]
9.  Register bryceboe.com
10. Setup [sedo][] for parking my unused domains
11. Create a very basic layout
12. Sleep
13. Watch tv
14. Add ads to the site
15. Create a better layout
16. Add my last.fm data to the site
17. Birthday party
18. Move content to a database

And finally write this entry. What a weekend. The good news is only five
pages left to go.
