I drive a 1985 Â½ [Porsche 944][] (the Â½ is very important) which I
purchased my junior year in high school. You might be wondering how I
could afford a Porsche at such a young age, as I wondered the same thing
when I saw the classified for it. The catch is these cars are quite
cheap, monetarily speaking. Nonetheless their cheap price does not make
them any less fun to drive.

I've had my 944 for just about four years and it still gets me where I
need to go. I make trips to San Diego about four times a year and about
one trip a year to San Francisco without any problems. All in all, not
including gas (it gets around 30 mpg highway), I've spent under $5000 on
the car; not too shabby.

Anyway, this weekend my girlfriend and I were volunteers at the [German
Autofest][] which basically meant directing Porsches where to park. That
wasn't too exciting however afterwards I managed to snap a few shots
with my phone.

If you look at the picture with the blue 911 SC you'll see my car hidden
behind it.

In other news I added a [Daily Drops][] section to priceTrackr. With
this I've noticed some strange behavior which I'm going to have to
figure out how to compensate for. The main issue is a problem with
Newegg raising prices for a few hours and then dropping them. This could
show up as a drop on the Daily Drops section but the graph may indicate
a raise in price for the day. I'll figure out what to do and fix this by
the weekend.
