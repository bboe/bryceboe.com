First I have to say Adam beat me to the post with his [Snakes On A Plane
review][] as I was fiddling around with some other stuff which I will
explain in a moment.

The movie pre party entailed Adam and Scott getting home with Demarco and
immediately shouting "Snakes on a Plane, let's go!" I ran downstairs and
quickly attempted to drink a screw driver which I failed at thus resulting in
me pouring the rest in a water bottle for the car ride. We arrived at the
theater at about 9:10 and a line had already formed outside. This was the most
unorganized line imaginable, but none the less Isla Vista was rallied for
battle. Were were armed with various weapons as some wielded beer (natty light
of course), some vodka (probably popov) and others weed (not too sure on this
but most likely cheap stuff). We were prepared to attack um, well... the
silence.

Every minute was filled with someone shouting "Snakes on a plane" and of
course performing Samuel L. Jackson impersonations. Finally the time
arrived when we could enter the theater. This was the most strange
entrance as well because two of the auditoriums were showing the movie
and we were free to chose which we wanted to enter. Once seated the
troops were eager for battle; beer cans were popped, vodca was mixed,
and joints started forming. I was armed only with my cell phone however
later acquired some popcorn which was all I needed during this epic
battle.

The Isla Vistians won the battle against the silence at Snakes On A
Plane. We cheered and shouted at every opportunity. Naturally the hot
girl was something to cheer for and we even broke out in Afternoon
Delight at the appearance of [David Koechner][] in nostalgia for his
role in Anchorman. We made sure everyone knew what snake vision was by
yelling "snake vision" every time the view point changed to that of a
snake, which apparently is green.

It was by far the best movie experience ever, which I think bias's my
opinion of the movie. To go in detail there were snakes, a plane, quite
a lot of blood, a very nice looking pair of fake boobs (if they're fake
they better look nice), a chihuahua and a wanna be Bruce Lee. Without
spoiling the movie I would definitely recommend seeing the movie so that
you may formulate your own opinion and perhaps have a chance at an
experience of a lifetime. Follow Isla Vista's example and take on the
silence.

Before I mentioned that I was armed with my cell phone and with this I
took a few video clips mostly to capture the excitement of the moment.
The reason why Adam beat me to the post is, one, because he wrote a lot
less than me, and, two, because I had to figure out how to quickly
transfer the videos from my phone to my computer and then find a way to
convert them so that YouTube wouldn't lose the sound. To make that part
of the story short I invite you to experience the excitement of a movie
with Isla Vistians.

One final thing I would like to say is that I obviously do not own the
rights to the brief amount of movie footage shown in the clips. I merely
attempted to capture the most invigorating moments of the battle of Isla
Vista against the silence. At any request to remove an offending videos
from YouTube I willingly will do so.

Now go see the movie! "Mother f\*\*\*ing snakes on a mother f\*\*\*ing
plane!"
