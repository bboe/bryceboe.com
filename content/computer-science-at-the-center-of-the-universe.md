I was just watching the keynote for [Google I/O][] in which Google's
CEO, [Eric Schmidt][] said, "I'm one of these people who believes
Computer Science is at the center of the Universe." I think this is one
of my new favorite quotes. Quote at 4:34 in the video below.

It's very exciting to read about the latest and greatest technology.
Sometimes, however, I stop and wonder if all this technology really for
the better? I was reading a blog post by Michael Zimmer titled [Amusing
Ourselves to Death: The Comic][]. His posts are mostly about online
privacy, however, this particular post brought attention to a comparison
between [Orwell's 1984][], which I've started reading, and [Huxleyâ€™s
Brave New World][], which I've now added to my reading list. I don't
have time to provide my thoughts on the matter, nonetheless I thought it
was worth sharing. I'll end by saying that if this technology wasn't for
the better, then I'd be out of a job :)
