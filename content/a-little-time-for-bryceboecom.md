My time recently has been filled with trying to complete [priceTrackr][]
so that I can go live with the service. I've sacrificed reading for my
history class and even taken shorter hours at my day job so that I can
work exclusively on priceTrackr. Truth be told I probably wouldn't have
done the reading and the task I'm currently working on for [WorldViz][]
is quite tedious thus I could not continue to work on it for more than a
few hours when I went in. I have however managed to neglect this site so
tonight I've abandoned my own blogging software and went to WordPress
which I must say typing in the WordPress editor is much easier than
using phpMyAdmin to do my blog editing.

With that being said I did move over my previous entries and I was
impressed with the ability to paste images into this blog entry. Of
course it just copied the html code but that is exactly what I needed.

What's left to do is to incorporate my [lastfm][] music data into the
WordPress layout as well as some google advertisements in case this blog
ever gets big and assuming people actually click on those links; the
money has got to come from somewhere. Also I'll have to look for a spell
checking addition to WordPress as I am very prone to mistakes.
