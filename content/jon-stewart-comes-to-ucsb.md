Wednesday morning's [Daily Nexus][] filled my body with excitement as
the title of the article reads, "[Comedy Central Host Jon Stewart To
Perform Live.][]" That's correct Jon Stewart is coming to UCSB and guess
who got a ticket? Scott and I!

After the second night of partying for Halloween I managed to wake at
7:00AM and rally the troops so that we could get tickets for this
glorious event. The tickets on sale Saturday morning were discounted and
only offered to UCSB students. Some may consider our seats to be of
inferior quality, but when it comes to Jon Stewart there are no bad
seats, and especially considering for non UCSB students tickets range
from $70-500; I'd say we got a sweet deal.
