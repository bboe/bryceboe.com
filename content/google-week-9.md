Damn! Itâ€™s been 9 weeks so far. Well the fun has continued. Monday
through Thursday was pretty standard. I advanced my project more, which
I realized I havenâ€™t mentioned much about my project. Well if youâ€™re
bored or interested in what I actually do checkout [the work Iâ€™ve
done][]. The number of results for this search should continue to grow
as more of my work is added to the project. Other than the standard
work, Monday I attended a [talk][] by Amos Guiora for his book titled
[Constitutional Limits on Coercive Interrogation][] which I received a
free copy. Itâ€™s pretty thin and I donâ€™t get free books to often so
Iâ€™ll probably read it.

Thursday night I went up to Miraâ€™s house in Berkeley along with
Rashida, Evanne, Victor, his friend Glen, Molly, Jessika (Bung) and Dan.
We went out to a Berkeley bar around 11 and I took off around 12:30 so
that I would be rested for work on Friday. It was great to spend some
time with old college friends. Ha! Old! My friends and I joke about how
the ridiculous things we did during the last four years are no longer
humiliating. Our joking rebuttal is simply, â€œguys -- that happened in
college.â€?

On Friday Rashida and Victor came to Google for lunch. That night I
stayed in the Peninsula area as many of my friends were attending the
Radiohead concert at Outside Lands. I ended up going out with Art and
meeting up with Julie and her friend (Iâ€™m terrible with names) at a
Palo Alto bar Nolas. We headed to the Rose and Crown and played some
two-on-two cricket. Julieâ€™s friend and I won the two games we played,
though the second one was very close. I believe a rematch is necessary.

Saturday, in San Francisco tourist fashion, I went on an Alcatraz tour
with a friend from high school, Mohammad. Prior to our tour we grabbed
some lunch to validate our parking giving us the opportunity to catch
up. We havenâ€™t seen each other since our first college spring break so
it was a great time. Alcatraz was pretty cool, but would have been much
less so if there hadnâ€™t been escape attempts. Following Alcatraz, Mo
and I went to a Sushi place and then just chilled at his apartment and
watched [12 Monkeys][]. It was on the in demand free movie list and
though I had seen it before, Mo hadnâ€™t so it was the obvious choice.

Sunday morning I headed up to Berkeley to help Bung move into the dorms.
She previously attended SBCC and decided to transfer to Berkeley.
Compared to the streamlined UCSB move in process that my mom and I
experienced, Berkeleyâ€™s was ridiculous. We waited in line for
approximately 30 minutes to get her room key and then had to make two
decent treks with a laundry cart full of stuff up hilly paths from the
car to Bungâ€™s dorm. It really wasnâ€™t that bad, as the company was
awesome, however I worked up quite a sweat.

I can only imagine what dorm life at Berkeley is like. I remember
learning that Berkeley dorms had coed bathrooms back when I was applying
for colleges, however I had since forgotten. When I rediscovered this
visually I shared it with Mira, which immediately after we decided it
would be an awesome idea to team pee, therefore we did. We discussed how
having a coed bathroom would be awesome in that it has high potential
for shower hookups, but terrible for those mornings, after a solid night
of drinking, in which a violent eruption of the bowels is imperative.
Despite knowing that the bodily functions of men and women do not
differ, I still refuse to realize that a female could have a
post-drinking dump anywhere near as brutal as some that Iâ€™ve
experienced. Unfortunately Berkeley dorm students probably cannot avoid
that realization for very long.

Following lunch at the dinning commons I headed back to my summer place.
After having gone through my five audio discs few times I decided that I
needed to swap in my mp3 cd stereo from the Porsche. Despite [this
consumerist article][] and poor [yelp reviews][] I went to a local car
audio store to purchase a wiring harness and an antenna connection
converter. According to the guy at the stereo store, Verenaâ€™s stock
stereo â€œrequiredâ€? a special tool to remove, which I asked if I could
borrow one. He informed me that they didnâ€™t lend tools to customers
but that he would remove it for $5. Last time I checked most auto stores
allow their customers to borrow tools, and in some cases they will help
their customers out for free. I definitely was not going to pay $5 for a
10 second job with a $20 tool. Being creative I used a few hex keys to
remove the stereo; so much for a â€œrequiredâ€? tool. I crimped the wire
harnesses together and then packed everything neatly back in place.
Everything worked beautifully and I can now listen to \~30% more music
before having to change a disc.

Spilling over into this week; Monday I made the decision to be a
research assistant rather than a teaching assistant fall quarter. There
are a few paper deadlines this quarter so it makes more sense to focus
more on research than to TA a class. Despite knowing I will have future
opportunities to TA a class, I am slightly disappointed that I wonâ€™t
be in the fall as I had been looking forward to it.

Monday evening I headed to Artâ€™s house where his parents had made a
Hawaiian style barbeque. The food was delicious and after dinner Art and
I watched For Your Eyes Only. I have been a huge 007 fan since Goldeneye
and so itâ€™s always enjoyable to watch one I havenâ€™t seen in awhile.

Finally today I felt like I got a lot done at work after submitting my
largest and most useful change list. Additionally I played probably my
best volleyball of the summer making a considerable number of blocks,
kills, and service aces. Iâ€™m still quite lazy defensively though. This
evening I attended a Stanford Womenâ€™s Volleyball scrimmage which was
pretty exciting to watch. Julie came for the last bit as she lives not
too far away, so we chatted it up a bit. And that brings me to a close.
Have a great week!
