Title: Useless Statistics

I was just checking out my Google Analytics and wanted to share some
random statistics.

1.  This site is the fourth result for [ucsb computer science drop
    out][] -- When I had previously seen this I was the first result
2.  My image is the second result for [vista screenshot][]
3.  I still hold the second result for [javascript timer class][] -- I
    intentionally wrote that entry to have a high google result.
4.  To my surprise someone found my site by searching for ["pantyhose
    story"][] which I am the 21st result, and I will probably rank
    slightly higher in a few weeks because of this.
