So I left work a little early today because they weren't serving dinner tonight
and because I had some stuff to take care of. Most importantly I was contacted
by this guy Tom, an EE major at University of Illinois, who would like to
donate a server and help improve [priceTrackr][]. So I of course was like hell
yes, thus tonight I have been running a few scripts to start collecting some
fresh [newegg][] data.

After crawling the user comments pages I have gathered over 35,000 unique
newegg product IDs with which we could seed our crawl with, thus essentially
eliminating the need for the user submitted add item page. However I don't
think we'll quite have the resources to update all these items multiple times
in a day, but one never knows. Maybe we'll start small and make a decent amount
of ad revenue to warrant switching to a cloud computing server structure. That
would be pretty sweet, but of course we must start with baby steps.

Anyway I'll make updates with priceTrackr's progress along with everything
else. Jeeze 3 posts this week; one might start to think I have nothing better
to do ;)
