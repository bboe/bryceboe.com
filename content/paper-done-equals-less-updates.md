I finished my paper before class Wednesday morning and it felt so good to be
done. The disappointing thing is I had another paper due the next day for my
Shakespeare class however this one was much easier to accomplish.

One thing I noticed is I have not added content to my site since my paper was
done. This further shows that I accomplish a lot more work when I'm
procrastinating.

In between my two papers I had time to finally setup the rest of my computer as
I received my hard drive and new mouse. For those of you that aren't aware my
main operating system is Ubuntu which is one of the best personal GNU/Linux
distributions. In addition to Ubuntu I dual boot with windows mainly for games
which I am getting back into with this new computer. As I have a beta copy of
vista I also made space and threw that on there.

For comparison here are screen shots of my three desktops:

### Windows Xp

### Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

This is *the* operating system. It may not be as pretty as the others but it is
much more reliable, and installing software couldn't be easier. I feel that the
majority of people using Windows basically use it for email, internet and
occasionally word processing or spreadsheets. Ubuntu offers all of this out of
the box and sets up most hardware on install so no need to find all those
driver CDs.
