So the hottest (or not) new search engine is [cuil][] (pronounced cool),
and let me just say my first impression of cuil is terrible. As with
most search engines I usually type in my name to see the results. Well I
guess cuil tries to add images with their search listings and for some
reason doing a search for [bryce boe][] lists my [UCSB CS page][] as the
first result with an image saying, "My Success in Scientology." **What
the fuck?** Where did this image come from? Perhaps from somewhere on
UCSB's domain but it is definitely not linked to from any of my pages.
Additionally why is my CS page listed first? BryceBoe.com has been
linked to from [digg][], as well as places like [ubuntuforums.org][] and
other places where I put my web signature. Arg! Cuil is not so cool.

There are some good comments on [this reddit thread][].
