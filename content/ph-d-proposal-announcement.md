Title: Submission and Feedback Tools to Support Growth in Computer
Science Education

Abstract:

The increase in popularity of teaching using visual programming
languages, namely Scratch, has resulted in new challenges for efficient
and accurate assessment of programming assignments that affect not only
introductory college courses, but also developing curriculum in the K-12
realm. Unfortunately, the visual nature of such languages makes manual
assessment considerably tedious and error prone. Furthermore, while
automated feedback and assessment tools have been used successfully with
traditional languages, their application to visual languages is not
trivial. We demonstrate the use of a static analysis tool in combination
with an automated feedback system that provides both summative feedback
for instructors and formative feedback for students. In this talk I will
discuss how two tools we developed can alleviate some of the problems of
a growing demand for Computer Science courses, both at the University
and the K-12 levels.

Everyone welcome!
