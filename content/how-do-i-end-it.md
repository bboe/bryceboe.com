Title: How do I end it?

Slug: how-do-i-end-it

Next quarter I am TAing the Operating Systems course at UCSB, which was
one of my favorite classes (I even mentioned it [here][]- see junior
year), despite it being considered the most difficult required Computer
Science course. For our class of \~50 students we had 3 TAs for whom
this class sucked the life out of. The class next quarter currently has
39 students enrolled, and I am the only TA, so it's going to be an
adventure to say the least. Fortunately the projects seem much simpler
than when I took it so that's a good sign. I think the projects were
simplified due to the struggle that our class had on the projects, which
is why I'm writing this. The following is the uncensored (though names
shortened) email thread that took place the night our last project was
due. This is by far the most hilarious email thread I've been a part of,
so enjoy. By the way, "How do I end it" was the title of the thread.

Note: V was our TA, [Ben Zhao][] was the instructor and CSIL is the name
of the computer lab
