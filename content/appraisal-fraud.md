While actually finishing my paper (I've been good tonight) I received my first
prospective offer for thepricetracker.com. I thought it may be too good to be
true. The email I received is as follows:

> Subject: thepricetracker.com (sent 07/26/06)  
>  From: Opera Software <chief@operaen.com>
>
> Hello,

> I found your domain for sale. Looks like this name has good potential. It's  
> something I'm looking for.
>
> Our company develops software so domain investing is not our main business.  
> Just additional way to generate income.
>
> Please email me price for your domain name. If it's reasonable we'll do  
> business.
>
> If you have other domain names for sale please send us the complete list
> with prices for consideration.
>
> Looking forward to do business with you.

Fortunately for me I did a google search for this Robert Hegglund guy and came
up with [this link][] and [this one][]. So it doesn't look like I'll be getting
$10,000 for this domain yet. Oh well.

Lesson of the day: Writing papers can even be interrupted by fraudulent emails.
