Title: Meme?

Slug: meme

So I'm sitting in my room pondering working on one of my projects and I get an
email saying I was just [meme][]-ed by [Cheri][]. Unfortunately, as many of us
know from facebook poking, virtual events do not correspond to physical events.
And if they did I can't even fathom what a good meme-ing would be like. Anyways
in a fashion strikingly similar to email forwards from the mid/late 90s I will
continue by writing eight things about myself and then pass it on.
Unfortunately [Adam][], [Jason][], and [Chris][] are the only bloggers I know
who wasn't already mentioned on Cheri's list, thus I guess I am doomed to have
terrible luck for the next 5 years.

The following are the rules. It looks like I already broke #4 as I posted
their links already.

1.  I have to post these rules before I give you the facts.
2.  Each player starts with eight random facts/habits about themselves.
3.  People who are tagged need to write their own blog (about their eight
    things) and post these rules.
4.  At the end of your blog, you need to choose eight people to get tagged and
    list their names.
5.  Don't forget to leave them a comment telling them they're tagged, and to
    read your blog.

Without further ado, my random facts/habits.

1.  I like to argue given the proper context, which is typically when around my
    friends. Sometimes I'll argue a point in which there there is no possible
    way for me to be correct. I don't purposefully take the *wrong* side, but
    rather just a side in opposition. I suppose I do this to make conversations
    more interesting, but it's tough sometimes because being wrong can be
    depressing.
2.  This one I'm slightly more embarrassed about but maybe making it public
    knowledge will help. I cannot keep food at or near my desk because I will
    eat it until it's gone. Occasionally I get sent treats, and no matter where
    I put them every time I pass by I feel compelled to have some. Thus the
    further from my room the better.
3.  I have a terrible time writing about myself, which is odd because I know
    the things I wish to hear when people talk about me. Thus I know what I
    think of myself, but ask me to say something positive about myself and
    you're likely to get nothing.
4.  I have already picked out a few possible names for my potential future
    children.
5.  I'm slightly stealing from Cheri's underpants story, but this is too good
    not to mention. During a volleyball game, in my senior year of high school,
    pantyhose fell out of my shorts onto the court, which was captured on
    video. If anything is to be learned from this lesson it was to double check
    my shorts for pantyhose before playing, alternatively I could be to do my
    own laundry, but that's just inefficient when visiting my mom.
6.  I went to [Space Camp][] as a child. Clearly I used to want to be an
    astronaut, and just recently this dream has been revived when I started
    thinking about what I actually want to do after college.
7.  I am never satisfied with myself. While this can be a good thing as I will
    always try to progress, it can also be bad in the sense that people with
    eating disorders are never satisfied with themselves. I feel that all the
    work I'm doing now is so that some day I will be satisfied and happy with
    myself. However, gradually I am beginning to feel that I'll never reach a
    point of satisfaction.
8.  Finally I suppose I oversimplify mostly everything. Adam and Scott call me
    overly optimistic Bryce because I base simplicity on whether or not I have
    a fairly decent idea on the subject matter. With tests, if I feel I know
    most of the subject matter than the test must be simple, and with projects
    if I understand how to do each part, then even if it takes me 100 hours to
    complete, it's still a piece of cake; it just takes 100 hours to bake.

Well hopefully after next week (finals) I should have a few interesting posts.
I have yet to write my python windowing toolkit comparison, and it seems like
that's dust in the wind. However, I recently did some work with OpenGL and GLSL
which I would like to share, so stay tuned.
