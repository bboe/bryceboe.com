Title: The Three Musketeers

College was something I didn't think too much about until my senior year of
high school, as I was more concerned with what was currently happening in my
life and wished not to bother myself with the future. Luckily I had [people][]
to guide me in the right direction thus allowing me to just barely make the
University of California (UC) extended application deadline. After the
application process all I could think about was my near future; would I get in
to my desired schools, and if not what would I do? A few months rolled around
yielding me with acceptance letters from various schools, the best being [Cal
Poly][], but no response from [UC Santa Barbara][] (UCSB). A whole month passed
before I received a letter from UCSB and I believe the words yelled upon
opening were simply, "fuck yes!"

Unlike most other students at UCSB, I did not attend orientation and thus I had
no clue what to expect on arrival. Fortunately Santa Barbara greeted me with
open arms and this place immediately became my new home. I arrived fifteen
minutes early to my first UCSB class, Computer Science 10, to find an almost
empty room; only two chairs were taken. This was my first encounter with
[Adam][] and Scott who too were attending their first UCSB class. I'm not quite
sure how, perhaps out of the sheer awkwardness of being the only three people
in a room that seats about 100, we managed to start a conversation. While I
don't remember much about the conversation, I remember asking if they were
second year students because I had the impression they did not just meet that
morning, however they informed me that they too were freshmen and I eventually
discovered they grew up together. Once class started I didn't think much of
them as I was too occupied with discovering what this whole "Computer Science"
thing is about, and when class ended we all went our separate ways, or so we
thought. Math 3C did not present me with an opportunity to be fifteen minutes
early, however upon entering the nearly full room, two people stood out in the
crowd of approximately 150. I don't believe we chatted during the first class,
however due to sharing half of our course schedule together we slowly
gravitated together, and this is how the three musketeers formed.

Following freshmen year, the three of us moved into the house which we still
occupy. Since we are all Computer Science Majors we created strikingly similar
schedules, and the odds were that if one of us was seen on the bike path, then
all of us were. Our house became, and still is, an ongoing discussion group
regarding anything and everything. We work on our homeworks together, and share
ideas for projects, all while avoiding [Academic Misconduct][], which our
school seems to be very strict on. While I don't agree completely with the
Academic Misconduct policy, because it hinders collaboration, I realize with
some students collaboration is a means to avoid some, or all work. As that is
not the case with us, living together contributes heavily to our success at
UCSB.

So why did I refer to us as the Three Musketeers? Prior to the end of Winter
Quarter 2006, we decided to apply for the BS/MS program which would allow us to
get a Masters of Science in Computer Science (CS) requiring an additional year
of College. During this period of time we, as a trio, made many visits to the
CS department and I guess people started talking. Moving up to just last week,
we attended the graduate student and faculty barbecue where we got to break
through the student professor barrier by sharing a few beers with those who we
attentively listen to while being lectured about various topics. Well, while in
line for food we just introduced ourselves to one of our professors, when
shortly thereafter a few words were spoke which went something like this:

> Person 0: You mean the Three Musketeers?  
> Person 1: Oh no! You spilled the beans on what we call them.

Since this occurrence we have started referring to ourselves as the Three
Musketeers, and are even thinking about dressing as the Three Musketeers for
one, of the many, Halloween nights this year. To finally wrap this up, Adam
turned 21 this past weekend thus Scott, and I are taking him out for his first
night on the town, downtown Santa Barbara that is.
