Today I had lunch at Google's newest Cafe, Big Table. I headed there at noon
and met up with some Santa Barbara Googlers. I didn't eat that much since
breakfast held me over quite well.

-   2 Falafel patties(?) with Tahini and Yogurt Cucumber Mint Sauce
-   Caesar Salad with Caper Anchovy Dressing
-   4 pieces of Tuna Poke Hand Roll
-   Plum Streusel Toffee Cake
-   A glass of strawberry lemonade

After lunch we explored the micro-kitchens in the nearby building because the
word is they had Hershey and Dorito products which none of the other
micro-kitchens have. It turns out this was correct so I treated myself to a
tiny size Krackel bar, tiny bag of nacho cheese Doritos, a few peanut M&Ms and
finally some organic jelly beans. I only had the M&Ms because they came out of
a cool dispenser, rather than the fun size packages they have in my building,
and the jelly beans because I had never had organic jelly beans before. They
were quite good, but tasted more like a cross between jelly beans and fruit
snacks.

Stay tuned for coffee/snack time, followed by dinner!
