I was working away one day and I missed a phone call. Just mom's cell,
so not usually worth investigating but this call was different. I am
notified via email when I have a voice mail as I use [Google Voice][]
for voice mail and when I finally played back the message, as you can
below, I felt like this kid should have an iPod. This call is the first
time, as I recall, that my little brother has called me directly, and
definitely the first time that he's left me a message so it's super
special to me.
