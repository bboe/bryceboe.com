Thanks to Adam Nelson's suggestion I registered [www.pricetrackr.com][]
thus pushing thepricetracker.com on the web2.0 bandwagon. With that
being said I'm continuing to work on
[priceTrackr's][www.pricetrackr.com] features while it continues to
collect data. I'm shooting for August 21st as the go public date which
hopefully will be sooner.

Until [priceTrackr][www.pricetrackr.com] goes public its features will
go undisclosed but as everyone has said thus far it will be quite
useful.
