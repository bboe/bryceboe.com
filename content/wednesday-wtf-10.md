I overheard a retold conversation between two people this afternoon. The
conversation went something like this:

> Person A: I just heard the most ridiculous thing.  
>  Person B: Oh yeah, what is it?  
>  Person A: My friend who works at [XYZ Coorporation] told me they discovered
> the problem as to why a few of their servers crashed. They found wood in the
> CPU socket.  
>  Person B: They found what!?  
>  Person A: They found wood.  
>  Person B: You must be kidding me.  
>  Person A: Nope. It would seem that the people who put together the servers
> stick all the memory chips in the slots at once, place a wood block across
> them, and then hammer them in. Apparently this sometimes causes splinters to
> fly off into other locations, and then in some cases the CPUs are added with
> little wood splinters in the socket, thus causing future issues.  
>  Person B: That's ridiculous.  
>  Person A: Indeed.

What the fuck? Why aren't they using a rubber block or something that doesn't
leave pieces behind. More so why are they hammering them in? I guess if your
job all day is to place memory chips into the motherboard your fingers are
likely to get sore. Nonetheless I agree with Person B, that's just ridiculous.
