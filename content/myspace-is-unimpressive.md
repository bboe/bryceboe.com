Slug: myspace-is-unimpressive

After at least two years of avoiding MySpace I finally did the unthinkable and
created a [profile][]. Now you may be thinking "why", or "are you mad" however
I assure you that I had good intentions to do so and I am not *completely* mad.

The main reason behind partaking this horrific task is for work. I am
contracted by a social networking company in which I will be testing some stuff
that involves MySpace. It would be quite difficult to perform these tasks
without an account, however I realize creating a fake account is not difficult,
and could even help me pick up little boys or girls, if I were into that (see
below). But I <del>sustained</del> refrained from creating a fake account
because I figure I can draw traffic here with my MySpace profile. The second
reason for creating a MySpace account is because I figured I should try it
before I continue to put it down.

Well I have now tried it, and I stand behind myself, if that's possible, when I
say MySpace is terrible. On my first visit I was quickly bombarded with a page
full of advertisements which weren't regular text or picture advertisements but
rather pages filled with flash advertisements. Because of these flash
advertisements my CPU resources were quickly filled immediately disappointing
me. I understand the need for advertisements, especially when MySpace is ranked
the [\#6 website for traffic globally][], however MySpace has taken this beyond
ridiculous which is light years away from acceptable.

The second thing that made my MySpace experience unsatisfying was their user
interface which partially has to do with their advertisements. Changing
settings, finding people and adding friends is not as intuitive as it should
be. A visit to "home" is required before changing any settings which could
easily be fixed by a user bar. The search bar at the top is set to search the
web as default rather than search for stuff on MySpace. I see no reason to
search the web from MySpace. Finally once I've found a friend I must view their
profile before I can chose to add them as a friend.

A few other things that irritate me is their layout which is far to cluttered.
This along with their bombardment of advertisements makes it easy to avoid
MySpace. Of course they don't ruin the profile pages in this way, but rather
leave this up to the user's almost inevitable devastation, such as in my
[brother's MySpace][].

With that being said [my MySpace account][profile] will be used only for
testing, and referring people to here and priceTrackr.
