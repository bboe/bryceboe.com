I was shown this blog [Cake Wrecks][] earlier this week and some of the things
on it are just absurd!

-   [Wedding Cake, of yourself][] -- WTF? Someone is a closet cannibal
-   [Literal Transcriptions][] -- The next cake I have ordered I'm going to try
    my hardest to confuse the hell out of the cake people so that I can
    possibly get it for free.

You can check the site out for yourself. Besides the screw ups on the writing,
which I find hilarious, the WTF really goes out to some of the strange cakes
that people request. I really can't imagine my reaction to someone handing me a
cake and saying, "this is part of right breast, enjoy!"
