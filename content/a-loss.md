Title: A Loss -- RIP Jaymie Darrow

Slug: a-loss

As a twenty-two year old, I am fortunate to have not lost any close
loved ones, however there have been four people who I was moderately
close to that passed away. The first, whose name is escaping me, was in
seventh grade when a fellow student who I shared classes, and
occasionally ate with, died from cancer. The second and third were
[Angela Nguyen][] and [Jonathan Kendall][]. I met Angela freshmen year
of college and later Jonathan when she began dating him. They were
traveling with some friends in the Bay Area during Winter break of our
junior year when their vehicle rolled and engulfed in flames; three
others survived. Finally a little over an hour ago I was told Jaymie
Darrow, who lived a few houses down the street from me at UCSB, was
found in the water near a <del>La Jolla</del> Palomar Mountain campsite. The
cause of death is uncertain at this time, but it appears there was no
foul play.

I would not say I was very close to any of these people at the time of
their death, but nonetheless in each case I have been uneasy about how
to react. It is sad to no longer have these people with us, but at the
same time death is a part of life. I live life aware that I could die at
any moment and when I think of my own death, I only concern myself with
how others will react. Should I die tomorrow I feel my death would be a
terrible burden on my parents, and others close to me, but that is my
only concern.

Therefore when a person passes away, I try to think of how they would
want us to view their death. Not knowing Jaymie very well, all I know is
she was a highly energetic and positive person. From this I can only
deduce that Jaymie would want us to think of her death in a positive
light. Thus I have this to say:

> Jaymie,
>
> I am glad I had the opportunity to meet you and hang out the few times
> that we did. Your death, as tragic as it is, will only strengthen my
> memory of you and the times we shared. This tragedy is a reminder that
> friends and family members will not always be around and therefore
> that we should make the most out of the time we have with them.
> Jaymie, you will be missed, but not forgotten.
>
> Rest in peace.
