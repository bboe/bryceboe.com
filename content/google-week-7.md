Last week wasn't too shabby if you ignore the worrisome Wednesday. Not
too much really happened, however I played volleyball on Thursday and
that evening there was a booze cruise for the interns and, their hosts.
As seemingly common with Googler only events, beer and wine were free. A
few hours of Rock Band followed the bus ride back to Mountain View so we
could sober up from the few drinks consumed on the 2000 person yacht.

Friday we had a TGIF which we followed by playing a little Rock Band.
This weekend I was pretty lazy. as I watched a few movies, some Star
Trek and finally a ton of Olympics. In addition I finally went through
three years of papers I needed to file. Since I recently stopped
receiving paper statements it was less filing and more shredding as I
decided the majority of the stuff could be trashed. Thus I rid myself of
approximately 4.5kg of paper. By the way on a side note I feel strongly
that we need to switch to the metric system. So I'm going to attempt
to use the metric system in all my writing.

I also finally backed up my pictures to [Amazon's S3][] service.
Currently I'm using [s3fs][] along with [rsync][] to handle this
backup. This worked well for my pictures, however there were
complications for some of the video files I have which are over 200MB.
The next step is to backup all my College work and various projects,
however the rsync method is less desirable for this as there are many
small files, and I'm better off packaging them up into a larger
compressed file.

I ended Sunday night by looking at a ton of cars and listing my car on
craigslist. Having driven a Porsche for the last 6 years I have become
accustomed to cars with exceptional handling. Thus I'm currently
looking at [Volkswagen Golfs][] and [Audi A4s][]. I'm really open to
anything, but we'll see. I drove a 2003 Golf this afternoon which I
really like. As one should be though, I'm concerned with what
potential future issues the car will have. Fortunately I'm fairly
frugal and with working at Google (perhaps I should surname my next car
McDougal?) I'm not terribly worried about paying for future car repairs,
but I would still prefer to avoid it as best as possible.

Well I think that's all for last week. Hopefully I'll have a car to
write about next week. I'm open for unique car names as I never named
my 944 and I think I should start off my next car properly.
