Title: Automated Feedback and Assessment of Student Submitted Code

Abstract:  
Increases in class sizes pose a problem for computer science instructors. With
a larger number of students to educate, instructors are forced to choose
between assigning fewer assignments and devoting more of their time to
satisfying the additional demands of larger class sizes. The first option,
reducing the number of assignments, decreases the overall quality of a course,
whereas the latter option, working more, scales only so far. Fortunately, a
variety of tools exists which provides instructors with a third option.
Automated feedback and assessment systems can provide significantly more
detailed feedback to large numbers of students than instructors are capable of
providing, and do so nearly instantaneously. The use of such systems allows
instructors to continue to assign a similar number of comprehensive assignments
despite growing class sizes, and also makes it possible for instructors to
focus their time on students who require additional assistance with coursework.

In this talk I will provide a brief history of automated feedback and
assessment systems, followed by an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art
automated feedback and assessment systems. Finally, I will provide an overview
of additional research opportunities provided in other areas of computer
science as a byproduct of using automated feedback and assessment systems.

Everyone is welcome to attend!
