Two weeks into my Google Internship I, along with many other Googlers, became a
holder of one very secret piece of information: Google Chrome. I've been dying
to tell people about it all summer, fortunately I know better than to leak
confidential information. However I no longer have to worry as [Google
Chrome][] was publicly announced today!

Apparently some snail mail was sent a little early so a few lucky people got
their hands on the [comic book][] earlier than expected, one of whom [blogged
about it][]. I didn't even know that this book was being made. It's kind of
cool to find out stuff about the company you work for from third parties.

Anyway it seems the product is set to release tomorrow. I unfortunately wont
receive immediate benefit from it since it's currently Windows only. Having
used it this summer, all I can say is it is awesome. The tabbed interface is
very smooth and having each tab as a separate process is a brilliant idea. I
cannot count the number of times that firefox crashes because of some
JavaScript problem on one of the many webpages I have open at a time. On that
note the JavaScript rendering in Chrome is unbelievably awesome. However it is
still in beta, and as such is currently not up to par with the feature set that
Firefox and Internet Explorer have, but I'm confident that it soon will be.

[Check it out tomorrow][]!
