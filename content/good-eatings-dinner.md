This evening I went to dinner at the American Table cafe with Steve.
Tonight's selection was amazing! I had:

-   A bit of grilled wild boar bratwurst with sauerkraut, caramelized
    onions, mushrooms, shoestring celery root, turnips, brandy, Guinness
-   A bit of pacific almandine tilapia with crunchy almonds, lemon
    teriyaki and diced ginger Shrimp
-   A bit of smoked salmon alfredo with orzo, roasted garlic, cream,
    arugula, parmesan cheese, chives, caper and red onion relish
-   A bit of sauteed broccolini with red cabbage, shallots, corn and
    blackberryâ€“walnut vinaigrette
-   A devil's food cupcake, with white chocolate-raspberry cream
-   A glass of water

I hope you've enjoyed this indirect taste of Google's food. I sure
enjoyed consuming it :)
