Just announcing that I finally changed my theme from the default. This is
pretty solid and basically the same as before with the exception of the fluid
rather than fixed width layout which I've been looking for. I'm going to try to
add some spacing so it doesn't take up 100% the width of the screen, and darken
the title but other than that I like it.

That's all.
