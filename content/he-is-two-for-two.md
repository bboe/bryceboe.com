[Last week][] I wrote about the awesome message my brother left me regarding
what he wanted for his birthday. Naturally I felt compelled to splurge a little
for his birthday so my other younger brother and I purchased him an orange iPod
nano. He happened to be with my mom when she checked the mail today thus
receiving his present a little early. Naturally he felt compelled to call me
up, and leave yet another awesome message.

Connor, you are welcome and happy birthday buddy!
