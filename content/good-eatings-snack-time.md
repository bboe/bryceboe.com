Around three a few of us headed over to the hub for coffee, and as usual there
is a different treat of the day. Today my snack time consisted of:

-   A few [profiteroles][]
-   An iced mocha special made from the friendly barista
-   A little piece of chocolaty goodness
-   About 10 minutes ago Travis and I had a shot of Knob Creek to polish off
    what was left from our Autotest party night
-   And I'm feeling a light beer to finish off the day will go well before
    dinner. I just selected a Kona Longboard.

Mmm enjoying my beer prior to dinner.
