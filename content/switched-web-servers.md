Buz's and my previous web hosting recently expired and thus on Sunday I moved
all our stuff over to our new server hosted with [WebFaction][] which I've thus
far been incredibly happy with. While I was previously used to working with
cpanel, their more advanced interface produces a much cleaner directory layout
which I greatly prefer.

Anyhow, in moving everything over I lost my "Subscribe to Comment" data thus if
you previously to subscribed to any of my comment threads via email you will
need to resubscribe to continue receiving those updates. Alternatively you can
subscribe via RSS to my [comments feed][].

Finally aside from notifying my readers of the former, I needed something to
test the subscribe to comment feature on my new server. I'll make an update to
this post confirming it works once I've done that.
