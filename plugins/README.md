# Sources

I want to keep the plugins in version control within my project as it makes it
simpler to configure the plugins. Below is a list of sources where the plugins
can be found:

* related_posts.py:
    https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/related_posts
* sitemap.py:
    https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/sitemap
