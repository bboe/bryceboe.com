                <p>Next quarter I am TAing the Operating Systems course at <span class="caps">UCSB</span>, which was one of
my favorite classes (I even mentioned it <a href="/2008/06/21/undergraduate-conclusion/">here</a>- see junior year), despite it
being considered the most difficult required Computer Science course. For our
class of ~50 students we had 3 TAs for whom this class sucked the life out of.
The class next quarter currently has 39 students enrolled, and I am the only
<span class="caps">TA</span>, so it&#8217;s going to be an adventure to say the least. Fortunately the projects
seem much simpler than when I took it so that&#8217;s a good sign. I think the
projects were simplified due to the struggle that our class had on the
projects, which is why I&#8217;m writing this. The following is the uncensored
(though names shortened) email thread that took place the night our last
project was due. This is by far the most hilarious email thread I&#8217;ve been a
part of, so enjoy. By the way, &#8220;How do I end it&#8221; was the title of the&nbsp;thread.</p>
<p>Note: V was our <span class="caps">TA</span>, <a href="http://cs.ucsb.edu/~ravenben">Ben Zhao</a> was the instructor and <span class="caps">CSIL</span> is the name of the
computer&nbsp;lab</p>

<p>V,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in <span class="caps">CSIL</span> and all I have is a coke can, a frisbee, a racquetball and about
800 lines of non-working code. My question is: How do I off myself while
still passing this&nbsp;class?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried swallowing the frisbee, and drowning in coke, but neither have
produced the correct output. Please help as the deadline is approaching fast
and I need the sweet&nbsp;release.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br>
 &#8212;<span class="caps">DK</span></p>

<p>Place the racquetball in your mouth and bite down while someone slowly poors
coke in your nose. Its called &#8220;waterboarding&#8221; (but with coke) and thanks to
the bush administration its now completely legal as long as you consider
yourself an &#8220;illegal csil&nbsp;combatant&#8221;.</p>

<p>How about actually helping us instead of just pushing it back. Some of us
make plans and when you guys keep pushing it back it gives an unfair
advantage to those who do not have other things to&nbsp;do.</p>

lab would like it extended. I was really just making a joke. We just want to
be done with&nbsp;it.</p>

unfinished codes can earn at least a C or C+. I cant be spending another

<p>V + rest of <span class="caps">CS</span> 170&nbsp;staff,</p>
<p>I am adamantly opposed to this extension (as well as to the original one for
that matter). This extension benefits very few people, mainly those who have
the easiest final schedules. For most of us, this is not the case, and we
will be forced to cut the project short even more prematurely than before.
This is necessary so that grades in our other classes don&#8217;t&nbsp;suffer.</p>
<p>The same people made the original &#8220;pleas&#8221; also likely failed to start the
project on time, and/or are simply incapable of completing this project with
a reasonable time alotted. Thus, this extension will actually hurt the
students that have done their best to go about this project the proper way. I
say this even after only being able to start the project on Sunday night
because of <span class="caps">ECE</span>&nbsp;152B.</p>
<p>I encourage you to (re)level the playing field and remove this&nbsp;extension.</p>
<p>Thank&nbsp;you,</p>

<p>That&#8217;s an excellent question. This study was compiled by the isla vista
students education intiative by experimenting on street bums. The results
were very conclusive and it was found out that exactly 6 beers (corona extra
only) provided enough &#8220;feel good factor&#8221; to fully enable the test subjects to
enjoy their day. However the study recommends 2 jager shots every four hours
after consuming breakfast to prolong this feel good factor. or the subject
can go to a strip bar. either&nbsp;works</p>
