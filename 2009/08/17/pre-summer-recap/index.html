                <p>Wow, where has the time gone? In my absence a great deal has happened in my
life so I&#8217;m going to break it up into a few chunks starting with stuff prior to
the&nbsp;summer.</p>
<p>As I briefly mentioned in <a href="/2009/03/03/flat-stanley%E2%80%99s-not-so-adventures-at-ucsb/">Flat Stanley&#8217;s Adventures</a>, winter quarter I TAed
the Compilers course for <a href="http://cs.ucsb.edu/~sherwood/">Tim Sherwood</a>, one of my favorite Professors. As a
<span class="caps">TA</span> I was primarily responsible for the course projects. I decided to write
<a href="http://cs.ucsb.edu/~bboe/static/projects">automatic grading utilities</a>, which despite the occasional bug were quite
beneficial to the students as they received immediate feedback when submitting
their project. Additionally they were able to submit projects multiple times,
thus allowing them to fix problems they might have overlooked. As my end of
quarter reviews were pretty good, I was selected as one of four Outstanding TAs
for the quarter in our&nbsp;department.</p>
<p>In addition to TAing winter quarter, I took two courses. One was a security
related course on malware and reverse engineering lead by my soon to be adviser
<a href="http://cs.ucsb.edu/~chris/">Chris Kruegel</a>. The projects in the course had us write a simple Windows
root kit, a <span class="caps">ELF</span> virus, a crack and a keygen for contrived programs, among a few&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>The second course I took was taught by <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~schauser/">Klaus Schauser</a> and was on scalable
web services. Klaus previously was a Computer Science professor at <span class="caps">UCSB</span>
however, he left to found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrix_Online">Expert City</a> which later was bought by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrix_Systems,_Inc.">Citrix</a>
thus becoming <a href="http://www.citrixonline.com/">Citrix Online</a>. He now is the Chief Strategist for
<a href="http://www.appfolio.com">Appfolio</a> a Santa Barbara company that provides an online solution to
Property Management. This particular course interested me as it is seldom
offered and web related topics fascinate me. A group consisting of myself,
<a href="http://adamdoupe.com/">Adam</a>, Jeff, <a href="http://www.regexprn.com/">Jon</a>, Krithika, and Shashank created the website
torrentphobe which was a torrent tracking service that utilized social
networks. It worked wonderfully, however after the course ended, and the money
for the servers was no more, we decided to shutdown our&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>During winter quarter I applied for summer internships. Naturally I reapplied
with Google, applied to Microsoft and a few other companies, however I never
would have thought of applying to AppFolio if I hadn&#8217;t taken Klaus&#8217;s scalable
web services class. I had little knowledge of AppFolio prior to interviewing,
however I wanted to interview simply to catch a glimpse of a pair programming
company in addition to gaining interview experience. The interview went quite
well, and to my surprise I was given an offer equivalent to that which Google
would offer. After careful consideration and discussion about finding an
appropriately challenging project, I was sold, and accepted before Google even
got back to me on my application. I must quickly say that I&#8217;m over halfway
through my internship and Appfolio is a fantastic company to work for. I only
have a few weeks left; it will be sad to&nbsp;leave.</p>
<p>Spring quarter I took a single course, Advanced Computer Architecture with the
same Tim Sherwood I TAed for. On a quick side note Tim is the Professor that
held the Programming Battle Adam and I won in the spring quarter of our
freshmen year in addition to taking us to Riverside for the <span class="caps">ACM</span> Programming
Competition the following four falls. Thus I knew this class would be amazing
even if the material weren&#8217;t the most enticing. The papers were definitely
dense but I learned some damn cool stuff. Therefore I&#8217;m glad I took the&nbsp;class.</p>
<p>My main focus spring quarter was with my <span class="caps">TA</span> responsibilities for the Operating
Systems course. I again gained a great deal of valuable experience, however
grading for these projects was not as straightforward as the grading the
previous quarter. The projects had very little area between doesn&#8217;t work at
all, and works perfectly. Thus in attempt to accurately grade the students&#8217;
understanding of material the projects were designed to convey, I had the
groups demo their projects. I think it worked out quite well, however as one
student pointed out in their written review it, the demoing process is not a
perfect method. They wrote, &#8220;[P]lease grade more harshly. People who <span class="caps">BS</span>&#8217;d the
assignments got the same grade as people who did them right.&#8221; Nonetheless
whomever they were comparing against must have done a good job at&nbsp;BSing.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the quarter notification came out that the graduating seniors
elected me as the Computer Science Outstanding <span class="caps">TA</span> of the year. That quickly
became a topic of toast when I was out with friends at a bar. I recall a few
times Adam or Scott would introduce me as Bryce, the <span class="caps">TA</span> of the year. I
attempted to not let it go to my head; sometimes I succeeded and others I
failed. Such is&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>On the Scotty and Adam topic I attended their Master&#8217;s graduation ceremony,
which was oh so boring. However, as with our undergraduate graduation, this one
naturally came the mimosas in the morning and much other celebration so it was
worth the hours in the sun. As all good things must come to an end, the
celebrations didn&#8217;t last too much longer. A few days later we all moved out of
our place on Sesame Tree. I moved down the road to Storke Ranch, and Adam and
Scott temporarily moved home to Sacramento prior to their big move to
Washington to work for Microsoft. The move marked the end of an era: the end of
the Three Musketeers. However, the move also marked the start of a new life for
me, which has been great so far. Nonetheless Scotty and Adam are&nbsp;missed.</p>
