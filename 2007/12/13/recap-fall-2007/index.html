                <p>Another quarter has passed at <span class="caps">UCSB</span> as I just finished my last final about two
hours ago. Overall this was quite an interesting quarter in which I started off
taking three classes: Intro to Networking, Computer Graphics and a special
class to prepare for the <span class="caps">ACM</span> Programming Competition. In addition to this
classes I signed up for Master&#8217;s research under <a href="http://cs.ucsb.edu/~ravenben/">Ben Zhao</a>, a fantastic
professor, and a few weeks into the quarter I added a graduate class on writing
and presentations. The writing and presentation class was one of the most
amazing nontechnical courses I&#8217;ve taken at <span class="caps">UCSB</span>. I gained experience presenting
as well as some tips to improve my presentation. While I continue to feel I
struggle with writing, I&#8217;ve discovered my main problem is not wanting to put
the effort into it, and when I put in the effort it&nbsp;shows.</p>
<p>To prepare for my networking research I was given a networking book which I
read a large portion of prior to the start of the quarter. As it turned out,
this was the same book used in the intro to networking class and thus I was two
months ahead of the class. Despite the repeat in material it was an amazing
class with an <a href="http://cs.ucsb.edu/~ebelding/">awesome Professor</a>; I can only hope the other networking
classes I take will be as exciting. With my reading and through the course I
can confidently say that I know nearly 100% of all actions that occur between
two communicating nodes on the internet. Of course we didn&#8217;t cover every
internet protocol, but nonetheless I&#8217;m a networking&nbsp;baller.</p>
<p>Since I work for a Computer Graphics Comanpy, <a href="http://www.worldviz.com/">WorldViz</a>, I signed up for the
computer graphics class. I wanted to get a better idea of how OpenGL and scene
graphs work as they, along with our program (<a href="http://www.worldviz.com/products/vizard/index.html">Vizard</a>), make everything so
simple. Unfortunately the class was taught by a Professor which I seemingly
cannot learn from, and given my chats with other students, I&#8217;m not the only
one. Thus, I was forced to learn everything on my own. My primary problem with
the Professor is his lecture style in which a single lecture may cover up to 80
slides of which he jumps back and forth between making it very difficult to
follow. I&#8217;m not an expert on teaching, however I know he is doing something
wrong as in a class of about twenty students only five would attend the
lectures. In a <span class="caps">CS</span> class one should expect just over half the class to attend,
but not a quarter. My gripes aside, with the studying I did for the final, I
finally learned some of the concepts I wish to leave the quarter with which
were matrix transformations and projections. I just wish I didn&#8217;t have to learn
it on my&nbsp;own.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">ACM</span> preparation course was awesome as there were only six of us in the
class with <a href="http://cs.ucsb.edu/~sherwood/">one of the coolest Professors on campus</a>, along with the other
two previously mentioned. We covered some advanced algorithms needed for
solving programming competition problems. As I mentioned in a previous post,
Adam, Scott and myself placed 5th last year at the competition without any
formal preparation, thus we were expecting to be much more prepared this year.
Unfortunately despite all the preparation, luck is also a factor in the
competition, and unfortunately I think luck was why we did so well the year
before. This year we placed 12th only managing to solve three problems. In
comparison last year we manged to solve five problems. My explanation for the
decline is in the previous year two of the problems I solved were dynamic
programming problems, my forte, of which none of the problems this year were.
Nonetheless it was fun and we&#8217;ll get to have another go at it next&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>On the research front I&#8217;ve been working on vulnerabilities in transport layer
protocols. I wont go into detail, however I will say research has been fun, but
<a href="http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/"><span class="caps">NS</span>-2</a>, the network simulator tool, is horrible. It interfaces with the
<a href="http://www.tcl.tk/"><span class="caps">TCL</span></a> scripting language which I think was a terrible choice as <span class="caps">TCL</span> has the
worst error reporting mechanism I&#8217;ve seen. I&#8217;ve silently been planning to
re-implement <span class="caps">NS</span>-2 using <a href="http://www.python.org/">python</a>, however it doesn&#8217;t seem worth it as I&#8217;m
hoping to not have to use <span class="caps">NS</span>-2 much after this&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>On the project front I had time for one project of my own and completed some
pretty cool projects for my classes. My own project I call Simple File Transfer
which I designed a protocol similar to <span class="caps">TFTP</span> and <span class="caps">FTP</span>. Like <span class="caps">TFTP</span> there is a very
limited number of commands, <span class="caps">GET</span>, <span class="caps">PUT</span> and <span class="caps">QUIT</span>, however unlike <span class="caps">TFTP</span> it uses <span class="caps">TCP</span>
to send data. Finally unlike <span class="caps">FTP</span> it sends data in band which means the data and
control signals are sent through the same connection in the same way <span class="caps">HTTP</span> data
is sent in band. For my graphics class we had to program a cube animation
sequence which included textures and shadows as well as a separate program on
generating Bezier curves. The networking projects were all simpler than my
Simple File Transfer and thus deserve no mention except for the extra credit
assignment in which we were to code up a proxy server. I chose to do this
assignment in python and the resulting code, with some extras, was only 107
lines; Python is awesome as demonstrated by <a href="http://www.xkcd.com/353/">this</a> <span class="caps">XKCD</span> comic, though I&#8217;ve
known it for far longer than the comic&nbsp;author.</p>
<p>Well I think I&#8217;ll wrap it up now as this has been a pretty long post. In the
words of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorman:_The_Legend_of_Ron_Burgundy">Ron Burgandy</a>, &#8220;You stay classy [the one or two readers I have].&#8221;
By the way if you do actually read this how about some comments which spark
discussion, or just comments? If you want to be anonymous just use a fake name
and a fake email address and assuming it&#8217;s a non-spam comment I&#8217;ll accept&nbsp;it.</p>
