                <p>Over the past month there have been a ton of happenings. For the most part I&#8217;ve
been working full time which is great as I&#8217;m making bank and I haven&#8217;t had a
chance to be bored. The first part of the summer entailed working on a
<a href="http://www.worldviz.com">Worldviz</a> demo for <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/"><span class="caps">SIGGRAPH</span></a> which is a conference for those involved in
Computer Graphics and or Virtual Reality. The demo involved Worldviz&#8217;s <a href="http://www.worldviz.com/products/livecharacters/index.html">Live
Characters</a> which is our solution to real time full body mapping to an
avatar. Using the Live Characters I created a physics body to map to the bone
structures and created a few interactive objects to demonstrate the use of Live
Characters with physics. The objects included a turbine fan which one could
spin giving aural feedback corresponding to how fast the fan is spinning. The
second involved virtual Weeble punching bag as can be seen one of the videos on
the Live Characters page. The third was a virtual form of a standard heavy
punching bag, which ended up not too appealing since motion capture doesn&#8217;t
involve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic">force feedback</a>. The last scenario worth mentioning involved the
user being surrounded by crates which they could then knock over and given a
little tweaking would enable the user to pick up the objects. There is also a
video of this on the Live Characters&nbsp;site.</p>

<p>Once the demo was prepared I took a few days off to see my mom and brother
Connor in Nebraska. It was good to see them, and I even got to see Connor ride
his bike; he&#8217;s a&nbsp;baller.</p>
<p>It was a time for many pictures as it was the first time in about ten years
that all of the cousins were together which was eight of us then and nine of us
now with Connor. In addition my mom scheduled the five of us (mom and her boys)
to get a family photo taken because this too previously occurred over ten years
ago and because Connor was upset that he wasn&#8217;t in the previous one hanging on
the wall. As far as I know it turned out pretty well; my mom loves&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>After Nebraska I returned to see my dad in San Diego and to attend the last day
of <span class="caps">SIGGRAPH</span> to see my demo in action. I personally wasn&#8217;t too impressed by it,
as after all I made a significant portion of it, however I got the impression
that other people were. Not so much the demo itself but rather what the demo
was demonstrating, which is great. Following that I went to see <a href="http://blogthismom.blogspot.com/">Cheri</a> and
Tom, then returned to Santa Barbara for a party the following day; it was a
nice little&nbsp;vacation.</p>
<p>Following the vacation I started a project at work which involves reconfiguring
our server architecture and moving all of our storage and <span class="caps">SVN</span> repositories to a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_area_network">Storage Area Network</a>. Thus far I&#8217;ve completed the task of moving the
exchange server over and setting up our local <span class="caps">SVN</span> repositories with <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>
projects as well. This whole process has kept me busy and is quite interesting.
Though not relevant to my future area of work, I always enjoy trying and
learning new things. The project has reaffirmed my hate for Microsoft products
as there is so much bullshit involved such as requiring multiple steps to
accomplish something that can be done in one line on a linux machine. For
instance adding a forward email to address in exchange requires creating a
contact (which shows up in the address book) and then going through about five
levels of user interface windows to link the mailbox to that contact. On top of
that as far as I know a mailbox can only have one forward to address, and the
user cannot set this up their self. On a linux machine I simply need to login
as myself and add a file called .forward with the email addresses I wish to
forward my mail to. While the two aren&#8217;t completely comparable because that
disables the storage of the mail on the linux box, it still shows how much
simpler things are in a linux&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>On the education side of things I contacted <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~ravenben/">Ben Zhao</a> (a professor I had in
the previous quarter) regarding working on a research project in the fall and
further upcoming quarters. He is happy to have me work on something of his and
I&#8217;m in the process of reading a ton on Networking and Networking protocols so
that I&#8217;ll be up to speed once the quarter starts allowing me to dive straight
into a project. It&#8217;s all very exciting and I speculate I&#8217;ll get my name on a
few research papers. It&#8217;s going to be a good&nbsp;year.</p>
