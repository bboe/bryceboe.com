                <p>First I have to say Adam beat me to the post with his <a href="http://adamdoupe.com/2006/08/18/snakes-on-a-plane-review/">Snakes On A Plane
review</a> as I was fiddling around with some other stuff which I will explain
in a&nbsp;moment.</p>
<p>The movie pre party entailed Adam and Scott getting home with Demarco and
immediately shouting &#8220;Snakes on a Plane, let&#8217;s go!&#8221; I ran downstairs and
quickly attempted to drink a screw driver which I failed at thus resulting in
me pouring the rest in a water bottle for the car ride. We arrived at the
theater at about 9:10 and a line had already formed outside. This was the most
unorganized line imaginable, but none the less Isla Vista was rallied for
battle. Were were armed with various weapons as some wielded beer (natty light
of course), some vodka (probably popov) and others weed (not too sure on this
but most likely cheap stuff). We were prepared to attack um, well&#8230; the&nbsp;silence.</p>
<p>Every minute was filled with someone shouting &#8220;Snakes on a plane&#8221; and of course
performing Samuel L. Jackson impersonations. Finally the time arrived when we
could enter the theater. This was the most strange entrance as well because two
of the auditoriums were showing the movie and we were free to chose which we
wanted to enter. Once seated the troops were eager for battle; beer cans were
popped, vodca was mixed, and joints started forming. I was armed only with my
cell phone however later acquired some popcorn which was all I needed during
this epic&nbsp;battle.</p>
<p>The Isla Vistians won the battle against the silence at Snakes On A Plane. We
cheered and shouted at every opportunity. Naturally the hot girl was something
to cheer for and we even broke out in Afternoon Delight at the appearance of
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0462712/">David Koechner</a> in nostalgia for his role in Anchorman. We made sure
everyone knew what snake vision was by yelling &#8220;snake vision&#8221; every time the
view point changed to that of a snake, which apparently is&nbsp;green.</p>
<p>It was by far the best movie experience ever, which I think bias&#8217;s my opinion
of the movie. To go in detail there were snakes, a plane, quite a lot of blood,
a very nice looking pair of fake boobs (if they&#8217;re fake they better look nice),
a chihuahua and a wanna be Bruce Lee. Without spoiling the movie I would
definitely recommend seeing the movie so that you may formulate your own
opinion and perhaps have a chance at an experience of a lifetime. Follow Isla
Vista&#8217;s example and take on the&nbsp;silence.</p>
<p>Before I mentioned that I was armed with my cell phone and with this I took a
few video clips mostly to capture the excitement of the moment. The reason why
Adam beat me to the post is, one, because he wrote a lot less than me, and,
two, because I had to figure out how to quickly transfer the videos from my
phone to my computer and then find a way to convert them so that YouTube
wouldn&#8217;t lose the sound. To make that part of the story short I invite you to
experience the excitement of a movie with Isla&nbsp;Vistians.</p>
<object width="480" height="385">
<param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/kpUIk7YwUGo?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param>
<embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/kpUIk7YwUGo?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object>

<p>One final thing I would like to say is that I obviously do not own the rights
to the brief amount of movie footage shown in the clips. I merely attempted to
capture the most invigorating moments of the battle of Isla Vista against the
silence. At any request to remove an offending videos from YouTube I willingly
will do&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>Now go see the movie! &#8220;Mother f***ing snakes on a mother f***ing&nbsp;plane!&#8221;</p>
