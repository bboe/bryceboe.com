                <p>Saturday November 11, five students from <span class="caps">UCSB</span> drove into Riverside, three of
which emerged (somewhat) <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/regionals/ViewRegionalStandings.asp?ContestID=767">victorious</a> and each $50 richer. This entry
chronicles the events leading to and during the <a href="http://www.socalcontest.org/">2006 Southern California
Regional <span class="caps">ACM</span> programming competition</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="ACM $50 Check" src="/images/2006/11/2006-acmcheck.jpg"></p>
<p>I mentioned the upcoming competition in my <a href="/2006/10/23/line-segment-intersection-algorithm/">Line Segment Intersection
Algorithm</a> post which was the start of my preparation for the contest.
Further preparation did not come until two nights before the competition as we
are lazy Santa Barbarians. Adam and I managed to talk Scottie into
participating with us thus giving us the <em>house</em> advantage as we all live
together. We originally registered four teams however only five people attended
giving us two teams, Bender and Morbo named appropriately after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama">Futurama</a>&nbsp;characters.</p>
<p><strong>The Night Before</strong><br>
In a traditional <span class="caps">UCSB</span> Friday night Scott and Adam partied though managed to
make it home well before the normal return time; I abstained Friday night
because I like to be well rested before day long&nbsp;events.</p>
<p><strong>The Next Morning</strong><br>
In a <em>nontraditional</em> <span class="caps">UCSB</span> morning the three of us woke up at approximately
6:45 to leave by 7:45 for the 2.5 hour drive to Riverside. One thing that must
be noted here is that the official check in was between 8 and 9 which we
definitely weren&#8217;t planning to&nbsp;attend.</p>
<p>Showers and a quick trip to McDonald&#8217;s prepared us for the day and put us on
the road by 8:00. We sang songs for two and half hours and finally arrived at
10:30. Surprisingly our other team with our coach arrived within two minutes of
us despite our unsynchronized departures. The six of us rolled in and tried to
find the check in booth but of course being late the booth was gone and special
accommodations were needed to get checked in. With all that squared away
Scotty, Adam and I completed the practice problem in 15 minutes and headed out
for lunch. Oddly, to us, we were one of the first teams there for lunch despite
the other teams&#8217; head start at the practice&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p><strong>Lunch</strong><br>
Lunch was exciting. Rather than planning strategy and preparing our minds for
the upcoming five hours of work we joked with Tim (our coach) about future
years&#8217; strategies. We came up with one brilliant plan, among other not so
brilliant&nbsp;ones.</p>
<p>The plan involves a team of strippers, or rather a team of some of <span class="caps">UCSB</span>&#8217;s
finest since the majority of our female class would make excellent strippers.
Throughout the competition these girls will cat fight and perform titillating
dances so as to distract other teams. They may even go so far as to flirt with
the competition. We being used to this, as it occurs all the time in our
natural environment at <span class="caps">UCSB</span>, will gain an upper hand and emerge&nbsp;victorious.</p>
<p><strong>The Competition</strong><br>
The competition started a half hour late due to technical difficulties. The
words starting the competition were, &#8220;You now have five hours,&#8221; which me
immediately joked as five hours to figure out how to open the packet, and the
woman guarding the printer from code thieves chuckled. Once the packet was
opened we took our places with Adam at the keys and Scottie and I yielding pen
and paper. After reading through the packet of seven problems I began solving
the fifth problem which was a nested box problem. This problem involved
figuring out the maximum number of boxes that can be nested in a given set of
boxes. I quickly recognized this as a dynamic programming problem and hacked
away at the code for it. I passed it off to Adam who had just completed our
programming environment setup. He typed it up, tested it and submit it for a
success on first&nbsp;submission.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Scottie began working on the third problem which involved calculating
how to order pages when printing a booklet, and in the down time Adam began
solving the second problem which was determining the best percentage one could
get in a class by dropping one, two or three&nbsp;grades.</p>
<p>After the fifth problem was solved I began working on the first problem as it
didn&#8217;t involve designing an algorithm, but rather just making simple math
calculations with a very complicated problem description. We typed this problem
up, submit it, and went for a break which occurred 2 hours into the&nbsp;competition.</p>
<p>Upon our return we were all cheers as the solution to the first problem was
correct. Scottie continued working on the third problem as he was floating
around a correct solution, and Adam was close to completing the second problem.
That left problem four, six, and seven for me to look at. I chose the fourth
problem which was a special program this year that involved interaction with
another&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>The fourth problem titled Uniclue was a simplified version of the game Clue, in
which we only had to come to the correct accusation in under 47 turns. There
are only 18 cards in clue which need to be accounted for before making an
accusation thus making the problem quite simple. I wrote the pseudo code for
this, and handed it off to Adam, who by this time had programmed a solution for
the second&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>My code had a few mistakes but with some solid debugging skills we were able to
quickly fix the mistakes and submit for a correct answer. With less than an
hour left and one problem just about correct we decided to assist Scottie in
finding the correct answer for the third&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>It turns out we had interpreted part of the problem wrong and were trying to
correct something that didn&#8217;t need to be corrected. Upon realizing that we knew
our initial solution was wrong for some number 1-200 and started checking each
of those (something we should have done initially). As a shot in the face the
problem occurred when &#8216;1&#8217; was entered. A one line fix gave us the correct
solution and rights to pick on Scottie for a few&nbsp;months.</p>
<p>Getting the correct answer on this problem had jumped us up to fourth place
from sixteenth or so, and with only fifteen minutes left in the competition we
rolled out, feeling victorious and singing &#8220;Olay, Olay Olay Olay! Gauchos!&nbsp;Gauchos!&#8221;</p>
<p>We now had to wait approximately an hour to see how far we were bumped down.
Finally it is announced, &#8220;Fifth place goes to <span class="caps">UCSB</span> Bender.&#8221;&nbsp;Maholler!</p>
<p><img alt="ACM 5th Place Certificate" src="/images/2006/11/2006-acmfifthplace.jpg"></p>
<p>As it turns out we do alright without a team of strippers, but it&#8217;s still a
brilliant&nbsp;plan.</p>
