                <p>Yesterday was quite an exciting day as <a href="http://www.pricetrackr.com">priceTrackr</a> made its presence known
with the help of my favorite news site <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a>. Excitement, anger, and
frustration carried me through the day. The following is a reenactment of the
events leading to, and of&nbsp;yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>9/5/2006 - 10:<span class="caps">25AM</span></strong></p>
<p>I suggested to Adam that I should self promote priceTrackr on Digg, which he
initially spoke against it because it would be more reputable from someone
else. I agreed, however I was only hoping to attract a few users from Digg, so
I decided to go forward with it. Since I was only expecting 10-20 diggs on this
I figured it would be best to digg to my blog entry allowing for someone in the
future to digg priceTrackr directly. In the long run this was a good and bad
move on my part, however I&#8217;ll explain this&nbsp;later.</p>
<p><strong>9/5/2006 @ 10:<span class="caps">48AM</span></strong></p>
<p>I submitted my <a href="/2006/08/27/official-pricetrackr-launch/">Official priceTrackr Launch</a> article to Digg, which Adam then
quickly posted a direct link in the comments, and, of course, dugg it. <a href="http://www.digg.com/tech_deals/Newegg_priceTrackr">Here&#8217;s
the Digg article</a>.</p>
<p><strong>9/5/2006 @ 10:<span class="caps">56AM</span></strong></p>
<p>priceTrackr had already received 6 diggs, and Adam said, &#8220;I hope your WordPress
doesn&#8217;t crap out.&#8221; I though that it&#8217;d suck to be a victim of &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect">the Digg
Effect</a>&#8221; so I downloaded the <a href="http://mnm.uib.es/gallir/wp-cache-2/">wp-cache plugin</a> and tested it&#8217;s
functionality. I had to fix one line in the code to get it to display the page
if there was no cached version. In addition Adam pointed me to the <a href="http://www.aviransplace.com/index.php/digg-this-wordpress-plugin/">Digg This
plugin</a>, which I figured would be cool to have on the&nbsp;site.</p>
<p><strong>9/5/2006 @ The remainder of the&nbsp;day</strong></p>
<p>priceTrackr had shot up to about 12 diggs rather quickly, but then settled down
so I was only expecting few more however I was resilient to let the article
just sit there. I made an effort to make a semi-meaning full comment every few
hours so that the article would reappear in the <a href="http://www.digg.com/spy">Digg Spy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>9/6/2006 @ About 9:<span class="caps">30AM</span></strong></p>
<p>Adam and I had went to the office for our day job and we were casually checking
the progress and noticed the article had about 30 diggs. About this time I
received a ton of emails from my update script indicating it couldn&#8217;t connect
to <a href="http://www.newegg.com">www.newegg.com</a>. Turns out Newegg&#8217;s www prefix didn&#8217;t work but
<a href="http://newegg.com">newegg.com</a> had worked just fine, so I fixed my&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p><strong>9/6/2006 @ Approximately <span class="caps">10AM</span></strong></p>
<p>Still checking the status Adam and I noticed there was about 40 diggs and a
user <a href="http://www.digg.com/users/herrshuster">herrshuster</a> made the comment, &#8220;Lt&#8217;s gt this on th front page, diggrs!&#8221;
I was still skeptical about making it to the front page as nearly a day had
passed, nonetheless my excitement level had gone way up, and my day job work
for that day pretty much&nbsp;stopped.</p>
<p><strong>9/6/2006 @ About 10:<span class="caps">30AM</span> (The Big&nbsp;Bang)</strong></p>
<p>I was constantly checking the most popular page of upcoming tech articles and
upon refresh my article had disappeared from the top of the list. My excitement
peaked, I yelled something similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Dean#Iowa_results_and_the_.22Scream_Heard_.27Round_the_World.22">the Dean Scream</a>, and immediately went
to check on the&nbsp;comments.</p>
<p><strong>9/6/2006 @ 10:<span class="caps">35AM</span></strong></p>
<p>Though I was filled with excitement I soon realized that my host probably can&#8217;t
handle the large influx of people on priceTrackr, as I had not enabled any sort
of caching. I sent an email to my host requesting they do all that is possible
to keep my server&nbsp;running.</p>
<p><strong>9/6/2006 @ 10:<span class="caps">36AM</span></strong></p>
<p>The Digg Effect was in full effect as my host as disabled my account. I
immediately called their technical service to resolve this, unfortunately
paying $6/month doesn&#8217;t give you much flexibility in what can be done. They
said they&#8217;d turn it back on, however they&#8217;d have to chmod my priceTrackr folder
until the traffic subsided. I asked them to put up a message stating the site
was down and politely hung up the phone despite my terrible frustration at the&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>At this point I wasn&#8217;t sure what to do as I didn&#8217;t want to spend $99/month on
a dedicated host when I wouldn&#8217;t need it within a week, but I wanted to get my
site back up as soon as possible. Adam suggested using the company&#8217;s dedicated
host temporarily, and that is what I&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>Comments on my blog started coming in stating my site was down; like I didn&#8217;t
know. My personal favorite was from ted who wrote, &#8220;<a href="/2006/08/27/official-pricetrackr-launch/#comment-19">your site is down,
probably will never visit again. nice knowing you</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>9/6/2006 @ <span class="caps">11AM</span></strong></p>
<p>I changed my <span class="caps">DNS</span> servers to point to the updated <span class="caps">DNS</span>, and made the necessary
changes on the host to allow my site to be reached. I then moved the files and
the database over, and finally waited for people&#8217;s <span class="caps">DNS</span> to&nbsp;update.</p>
<p><strong>9/6/2006 @ 1:<span class="caps">19PM</span></strong></p>
<p>I <a href="/2006/08/27/official-pricetrackr-launch/#comment-29">posted</a> in my comments that priceTrackr was back up, however I forgot to
mention that it only applied for people who&#8217;s <span class="caps">DNS</span> had received the&nbsp;update.</p>
<p><strong>9/6/2006 @ The rest of the&nbsp;day</strong></p>
<p>The diggs kept going up and people visited both this site was well as
priceTrackr. Of course some people weren&#8217;t able to get to priceTrackr well into
the evening, but there wasn&#8217;t much I could do about that. After all the
excitement a delayed hangover set in, so no day job work was&nbsp;accomplished.</p>
<p>Later that night I implemented <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/Cache_Lite">pear&#8217;s Cache_Lite</a> (I am a proud supporter
of the pear packages), which to my surprise was amazingly simple and greatly
decreased the server load, as well as the page loading&nbsp;time.</p>
<p><strong>Results of being&nbsp;dugg</strong></p>
<p>I mentioned before digging to my blog was both good and bad, and here is why:
Digging to my blog was beneficial because this site was down for approximately
10 minutes where priceTrackr was down at least two hours or more depending on
the user&#8217;s <span class="caps">DNS</span>. The negative side of this was I received about two times as
many visitors to my blog than I did to priceTrackr. I know this has to do with
priceTrackr being unreachable, but nonetheless those people did not get to see&nbsp;priceTrackr.</p>
<p>Traffic graph of bryceboe.com<br />

<p>Traffic graph of priceTrackr.com<br />
<img alt="priceTrackr Traffic Graph" src="/images/2006/09/2006-ptdigggraph.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see priceTrackr had two spikes which definitely hurt the amount of
traffic that visited the site. For those of you that are wondering I made about
$20 from <a href="https://google.com/adsense/">Google Adsense</a> yesterday which isn&#8217;t too shabby. If I can
consistently pull in at least $5 a day I will upgrade to a dedicated&nbsp;host.</p>
<p>Finally I just want to thank everyone who dugg priceTrackr despite the self
promotion. I hope priceTrackr will be useful and there is anything that you
would like to see please send me an email or make a comment. You may check on
the status of priceTrackr at the <a href="/projects/pricetrackr/">priceTrackr project page</a>. Thanks&nbsp;again.</p>
