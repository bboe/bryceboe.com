                <p>Damn! It&#8217;s been 9 weeks so far. Well the fun has continued. Monday through
Thursday was pretty standard. I advanced my project more, which I realized I
haven&#8217;t mentioned much about my project. Well if you&#8217;re bored or interested in
what I actually do checkout <a href="http://autotest.kernel.org/search?q=bboe">the work I&#8217;ve done</a>. The number of results for
this search should continue to grow as more of my work is added to the project.
Other than the standard work, Monday I attended a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-JoXL8iaNM">talk</a> by Amos Guiora for
his book titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Constitutional-Limits-Coercive-Interrogation-Guiora/dp/0195340310">Constitutional Limits on Coercive Interrogation</a> which I
received a free copy. It&#8217;s pretty thin and I don&#8217;t get free books to often so
I&#8217;ll probably read&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Thursday night I went up to Mira&#8217;s house in Berkeley along with Rashida,
Evanne, Victor, his friend Glen, Molly, Jessika (Bung) and Dan. We went out to
a Berkeley bar around 11 and I took off around 12:30 so that I would be rested
for work on Friday. It was great to spend some time with old college friends.
Ha! Old! My friends and I joke about how the ridiculous things we did during
the last four years are no longer humiliating. Our joking rebuttal is simply,
&#8220;guys &#8212; that happened in&nbsp;college.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Friday Rashida and Victor came to Google for lunch. That night I stayed in
the Peninsula area as many of my friends were attending the Radiohead concert
at Outside Lands. I ended up going out with Art and meeting up with Julie and
her friend (I&#8217;m terrible with names) at a Palo Alto bar Nolas. We headed to the
Rose and Crown and played some two-on-two cricket. Julie&#8217;s friend and I won the
two games we played, though the second one was very close. I believe a rematch
is&nbsp;necessary.</p>
<p>Saturday, in San Francisco tourist fashion, I went on an Alcatraz tour with a
friend from high school, Mohammad. Prior to our tour we grabbed some lunch to
validate our parking giving us the opportunity to catch up. We haven&#8217;t seen
each other since our first college spring break so it was a great time.
Alcatraz was pretty cool, but would have been much less so if there hadn&#8217;t been
escape attempts. Following Alcatraz, Mo and I went to a Sushi place and then
just chilled at his apartment and watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114746/">12 Monkeys</a>. It was on the in
demand free movie list and though I had seen it before, Mo hadn&#8217;t so it was the
obvious&nbsp;choice.</p>
<p>Sunday morning I headed up to Berkeley to help Bung move into the dorms. She
previously attended <span class="caps">SBCC</span> and decided to transfer to Berkeley. Compared to the
streamlined <span class="caps">UCSB</span> move in process that my mom and I experienced, Berkeley&#8217;s was
ridiculous. We waited in line for approximately 30 minutes to get her room key
and then had to make two decent treks with a laundry cart full of stuff up
hilly paths from the car to Bung&#8217;s dorm. It really wasn&#8217;t that bad, as the
company was awesome, however I worked up quite a&nbsp;sweat.</p>
<p>I can only imagine what dorm life at Berkeley is like. I remember learning that
Berkeley dorms had coed bathrooms back when I was applying for colleges,
however I had since forgotten. When I rediscovered this visually I shared it
with Mira, which immediately after we decided it would be an awesome idea to
team pee, therefore we did. We discussed how having a coed bathroom would be
awesome in that it has high potential for shower hookups, but terrible for
those mornings, after a solid night of drinking, in which a violent eruption of
the bowels is imperative. Despite knowing that the bodily functions of men and
women do not differ, I still refuse to realize that a female could have a
post-drinking dump anywhere near as brutal as some that I&#8217;ve experienced.
Unfortunately Berkeley dorm students probably cannot avoid that realization for
very&nbsp;long.</p>
<p>Following lunch at the dinning commons I headed back to my summer place. After
having gone through my five audio discs few times I decided that I needed to
swap in my mp3 cd stereo from the Porsche. Despite <a href="http://consumerist.com/tag/bad-install/?i=5020723&amp;t=car-stereo-company-tries-to-install-gps-causes-1239854-damage-to-your-car">this consumerist article</a>
and poor <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-car-stereo-company-los-altos#hrid:f3ia9ggynOqFhrRGuHaGSA/query:Car%20Stereo">yelp reviews</a> I went to a local car audio store to purchase a
wiring harness and an antenna connection converter. According to the guy at the
stereo store, Verena&#8217;s stock stereo &#8220;required&#8221; a special tool to remove, which
I asked if I could borrow one. He informed me that they didn&#8217;t lend tools to
customers but that he would remove it for $5. Last time I checked most auto
stores allow their customers to borrow tools, and in some cases they will help
their customers out for free. I definitely was not going to pay $5 for a 10
second job with a $20 tool. Being creative I used a few hex keys to remove the
stereo; so much for a &#8220;required&#8221; tool. I crimped the wire harnesses together
and then packed everything neatly back in place. Everything worked beautifully
and I can now listen to ~30% more music before having to change a&nbsp;disc.</p>
<p>Spilling over into this week; Monday I made the decision to be a research
assistant rather than a teaching assistant fall quarter. There are a few paper
deadlines this quarter so it makes more sense to focus more on research than to
<span class="caps">TA</span> a class. Despite knowing I will have future opportunities to <span class="caps">TA</span> a class, I
am slightly disappointed that I won&#8217;t be in the fall as I had been looking
forward to&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Monday evening I headed to Art&#8217;s house where his parents had made a Hawaiian
style barbeque. The food was delicious and after dinner Art and I watched For
Your Eyes Only. I have been a huge 007 fan since Goldeneye and so it&#8217;s always
enjoyable to watch one I haven&#8217;t seen in&nbsp;awhile.</p>
<p>Finally today I felt like I got a lot done at work after submitting my largest
and most useful change list. Additionally I played probably my best volleyball
of the summer making a considerable number of blocks, kills, and service aces.
I&#8217;m still quite lazy defensively though. This evening I attended a Stanford
Women&#8217;s Volleyball scrimmage which was pretty exciting to watch. Julie came for
the last bit as she lives not too far away, so we chatted it up a bit. And that
brings me to a close. Have a great&nbsp;week!</p>
