                <p>First I would like to acknowledge my mother&#8217;s coworkers who started reading
following last week&#8217;s bidet story. I hate to set the bar low, however I do not
think I will be able to keep up to par with that level of humor. Anyway thanks
for reading and please feel free to leave comments, as that&#8217;s one thing this
site is lacking&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>Week 3 was not as eventful as the previous weeks, however the highlight of the
week was lunch with Cheri on Monday. Cheri, who I think of as a second mother,
was in the Bay visiting her eldest daughter Kristen and Kristen&#8217;s boyfriend
Adam. When she arrived at Google I presented her with my <a href="http://www.bookstore.ucsb.edu/graduation/grad_commence_attire.html">Stole of Gratitude</a>
for all that she has done to aid in my college success which started when she
pushed me to apply to colleges during my senior year of high school. For that
and the countless other ways she has helped me, I owe her my deepest gratitude.
So once again, thank you&nbsp;Cheri.</p>
<p>As I mentioned previously each of the Google lobbies have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_Juice">Naked Juice</a>
shelf with seemingly all 28 varieties of the drink. Starting last week I made
it my goal to drink every flavor, one each morning. I shared this information
with the receptionist in my lobby who thought it was an excellent idea which I
think is because she may have already conquered this feat. Anyway she&#8217;s quite
cute, so every morning following breakfast I go into the lobby to grab a naked
juice and chat with her. Such a great way to start the&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>Following Monday&#8217;s lunch with Cheri nothing worth mentioning happened until
Friday. Friday I attended a talk given by a fellow Ph.D intern, and later in
the day we had a <span class="caps">T.G.I.F.</span> social in which there was free wine and beer, as well
as various hors d&#8217;Å“uvre. An intern who also is a <span class="caps">DJ</span> provided the music for the
social. I had a buzzing amount of beer and then went and checked out Sergey and
Larry&#8217;s office with some other interns followed by a game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutthroat_(pool)">cutthroat</a>.</p>
<p>Saturday I went to the Computer History Museum with other <span class="caps">UCSB</span> graduate
students. The Museum was quite interesting though only two percent of their
collection is currently on display. The free tour (admission was free too)
covered various stages of computing from punch cards to vacuum tubes to
integrated circuits to super computers and finally to personal&nbsp;computers.</p>
<p>Saturday evening I had a delicious dinner at Victor&#8217;s, courtesy of his mom, and
then he and I went to Berkeley to meet up and drink with our friends Mira and
Molly. Since I had just received my first paycheck on Friday, the first round
of Patron shots were on&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>Anyway that was the week. I am still greatly enjoying my summer. To end this
(and hopefully provoke comments) I want to spice it up by commenting on a video
clip I saw on the news last week. Unfortunately I cannot find the clip online,
nonetheless the context was two Southern people were asked how they would feel
about having an African American president. One lady&#8217;s cut response was &#8220;I
think he&#8217;s a Muslim&#8221;, and another man&#8217;s response was something along the lines
of &#8220;there aren&#8217;t many black people around here. The only black people I see
asking for change are holding out a&nbsp;cup.&#8221;</p>
<p>I comment to this in the form of the following questions:<br>
Does having a middle name of Hussein really imply that someone is Muslim? And
more importantly, what would it matter if Obama was? Are the parents of
children not teaching their kids to be accepting of everyone despite their skin
color, religious beliefs and sexual preference? What message are our nation&#8217;s
citizens sending their kids about acceptance when they are openly opposed to a
candidate solely on the basis of race or religion. And finally, why are we
still considering religion when making political&nbsp;decisions?</p>
<p>I hope everyone has a great&nbsp;week!</p>
