                <p>The drive back down to Santa Barbara was awesome. I really got to enjoy
<a href="/2008/08/17/google-week-8/">Verena</a> and test out the roof rack system with my bike on top. Despite
having more stuff than I came up with, the increased space in Verena left me
with plenty of visibility. Upon arriving in Santa Barbara I headed to Frank,
Mark and Dave&#8217;s house whose garage would be my home for the next&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>Monday I attended a new student orientation for the Department of Computer
science. I&#8217;m pretty sure I had heard most of the material already, but I was
not there for the information. I was there to meet the new faces that I would
likely be hanging out with for the next five years. Among the new Ph.D.
students was a girl from Lebanon, a married man with two kids from South Africa
and some other familiar&nbsp;faces.</p>
<p>Tuesday there was an all department <span class="caps">TA</span> orientation in which myself along with a
few other <span class="caps">CS</span> students attended the breakout sessions TAing Engineering Students
and Profiles of <span class="caps">UCSB</span> Students. The second session was rather interesting as I
found the &#8220;profiles&#8221; of <span class="caps">UCSB</span> students to be rather accurate. Additionally it
was also the first time I heard the phrase <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_parent">Helicopter parent</a>, which seemed
incredibly strange to me since my parents are definitely not that way, and as
far as I can tell none of my friends&#8217; parents are either. Nonetheless since I
heard the phrase I&#8217;ve overheard people&#8217;s conversations with Helicopter parents
and I must say it&#8217;s ridiculous how involved some parents&nbsp;are.</p>
<p>By Wednesday Scott and Adam were back and the three of us started the hunt for
a place to live. We started with Sesame Tree, the place we originally planned
to live, despite being told we didn&#8217;t meet their income requirement. We figured
since we had plenty of income from the summer to cover expenses we could work
around it. We were told us they would consider&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>Class started on Thursday and my only class was <span class="caps">CS</span> 594 which is a course
offered by the Computer Science Department on writing and presentations. I took
the course last fall, but my writing can always improve as well as my
presentation skills, thus I signed up to take it again. Friday I received a
call in the morning that we could live at Sesame Tree under one circumstance,
paying all nine months rent up front. Given the apartment&#8217;s fair price, as well
as its proximity to <span class="caps">UCSB</span>, we decided to pay a significant portion of our summer
savings up front for nine months rent. It was by far the most money I had ever
spent at&nbsp;once.</p>
<p>Friday night we were given the keys, and Saturday morning we got a U-haul to
make the two trips from our storage unit to our new place. Most of the weekend
was spent unpacking and settings things up, but by the end of the weekend I was
fully moved into my room. Since this time I have absolutely loved my new room
as it feels like an actual room, unlike the hallway-ish room I had for the last
three years. Finally words cannot describe how awesome sleeping on my own bed
for the first time since June was, however I can say that I was finally&nbsp;home.</p>
